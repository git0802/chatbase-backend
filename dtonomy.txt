Put the Power of AI-based Security Analysis to Work
Triaging 100’s or 1,000’s of alerts every day keeps security teams very busy. While frustrated by the overwhelming number of alerts, repetitive false positives and endless detection tuning, they are hyper-concerned about missing false negatives. DTonomy’s founders set out to build AI-based cross-correlation and adaptive learning capabilities that instead of looking for anomalies, looks for relationships between alerts; instead of manually figuring out the best detection logic, the system ‘learns-out’ false positives patterns based on security analyst’s activities. The SOC team’s knowledge gained from the time-consuming consolidation and analysis is saved and used to optimize future security operations responses automatically.
Give your rockstar SecOps team a helping hand to:
AI-based Analysis FOR Security Analysts  BUILT BY Security Analysts
DTonomy leverages patented AI technology to automatically and continuously correlate alerts into attack progression stories, learn patterns from senior analysts adaptively, suggests more automation opportunities, empowering security teams to investigate more detection events with less effort.
Trustworthy AI 
AI is often seen as a black box where the output is hard to explain. This limits security analysts’ willingness to trust AI systems to automate actions.  Instead, DTonomy is open box AI to ensure the AI outputs are explainable, controllable and adaptive. 
Key Benefits:
Pattern Discovery Engine
DTonomy automatically cross-correlates alerts with DTonomy’s patent–pending advanced correlation/graph mining algorithm and presents them intuitively against the MITRE ATT&CK framework. By augmenting the manual cross-correlation process with AI-based discovery, security teams can analyze significantly more alerts in less time with new insights. Besides reducing analyst efforts, this automation also reduces the risk that alerts requiring attention will go un-investigated.
Key Benefits:
Adaptive Learning Engine
DTonomy continuously collects feedback from users and provides customer-specific adaptive risk scores based on historic trends. This eliminates time spent repetitively reviewing false positives, enables focus on highest risk issues personalized to your environments, and identifies associated risks sooner. Meanwhile, DTonomy AIR also learns decision patterns from senior security analysts driving continuous knowledge transfer across the team.
Key Benefits:
Recommendation Engine

DTonomy keeps track of historical responses of your team and community, provides relevant, in-context, and automated best practice recommendations that are personalized to your industry
Key Benefits:
How DTonomy's AI Engine Works 
Reduce Risk of Missing AttacksEliminate Alert FatigueOptimize Your SOC
Less Manual Context Stitching
Manual alerts correlation is time consuming and hard to keep track of progressive attacks. DTonomy’s algorithm driven correlation reveals hidden insights among security detections automatically, constructs rich context continuously for investigation, saves your time on endless correlation rules creation/tuning. 
Learn False Positives Patterns
Security alerts are full of false positives because generic detection logic does not include your environment context.  DTonomy’s trustworthy AI (Reinforcement Learning) engine continuously learns your security responses, identifies false positives patterns, saving your time tuning detection rules, keeping your SOC Optimized.
More Automations Unlocked
Manual response is time-consuming and error-prone. DTonomy’s 100s integrations enable you to easily create response automation with drag-and-drop workflows and built-in playbooks. Our AI-based recommendation enables you to build out more automations. Save time, reduce human errors and decrease alert fatigue.

The Gap between Security Detections and Response
Share This Post
The evolution of the Security Operation Center(SOC)
Security Information and Event Management Platform (SIEM) have gradually become the center of SOC center. It creates a variety of interesting security detections(alerts) that security analysts have to respond to. Usually, a tier 1 analyst performs the initial triage of SIEM alerts and escalates high-priority ones to tier 2 or tier 3 for a more thorough threat hunting. The goal is to identify which actions the SOC team should take, how to stop a breach and how to prevent one in the future.
To assist the SOC team in quickly investigating and responding to security issues, new technologies are invented to assist security analysts such as Security Orchestration and Automation (SOAR). It is great to automate lots of low-level tasks and has great potentials but it also comes with a few challenges. First, security analysts have to know what to automate. Examples such as “if there are too many brute force logins, then lock down account” is not effective automation. Analysts feel risky to automate these responses because they lack confidence in the analysis.
The gap between Detection and Response
The gap between detection and response characterizes the manual effort required by security analysts to investigate each alert in order to either dismiss it as false positive or unveil the details of an attack to remediate it. 
When a security alert arrives, a security analyst will ask…
Security teams are constantly facing these challenges. Unfortunately, their ability to review each alert and fully investigate potential threats is limited by the time-consuming effort that each alert requires. Consequently, security teams ignore early threat activity, only triaging high priority alerts which increases the risk of missing attacks.
The better response lies in better analysis.

						Too many alerts and too little resources?					
AI-based Security Analysis and Response:
DTonomy invented the solution to enable security analysts to reach an conclusion on false positive quicker and reduce the risk of missing true positives. How does it work? Let’s do a side by side comparison. 
Without DTonomy
With DTonomy
Context Building:
step 1: rank security alerts by risk score
step 2: parse artifacts within security alerts
step 3: enrich security alerts with asset information from CMDB, external threat intelligence etc.
step 4: evaluate historical investigation on similar alerts (~20 minutes/alert)
step 5: manually correlate security alerts and create a case for them (~50 minutes/alert)
 
Context Building:
step 1: review correlated alerts in cases directly ranked by aggregated risk score
 
 
 
 
Decision: 
step 6: if they are definitive true positives (1%), evaluate the impact via threat hunting and take actions to stop it.  
 
step 7: if they are definitive false positives (40%),  mark them as false positives. 
step 8: if they are not clear at this moment(59%), conduct threat hunting(5 hours/alert) or leave them open and forget about it. (Huge risk!)  
Decision: 
step 2: if they are definitive true positive, assess the impact via threat hunting and take actions to stop it.
step 3: if they are definitive false positive patterns, resolve them at once! 
step 4: for alerts that are uncertain, leave them there. DTonomy will pick them up if new relevant detection signals show up.  (Reduce the risk of missing a true alert!) If nothing shows up, they will be in sleep mode until been waken up. 
Optimize:
step 9: conduct group meetings to fine tune detection logic to avoid false positives(Risk of over tuning causing missing true positives!) , adjust risk of certain detections and package up some discoveries for other team to fix.                    (20 hours/week+)
Optimize:
step 5: DTonomy learns from your response continuously and automatically adjust risk score, identify false positive pattern which will be used to guide future investigations without touching master detections rules.(Reduce risk of tuning out important signals!) 
Get to answer of “false positive” faster.
Reduce the risk of “false negative”.
Get a definitive answer on “false positive”.

Fit into your current investigation workflow
Instead of replacing existing threat detection capabilities and workflows, DTonomy has integrations with SIEM and SOAR platform so that it fits into your environment seamlessly.
By seamlessly fitting into existing alert triage and investigation workflows, DTonomy bridges the gap between detection and response, compressing their time on security alerts analysts augmenting their existing workflows.

                            Eliminate False Positive and De-Risk False Negatives                        
Eliminate False Postives and Minimize FALSE NEGATIVE Risks
THE CHALLENGE:
While facing a large number of false-positive, it is error-prone to falsely mark something as a false positive. FALSE NEGATIVES are easily buried in false positives. Failure to recognize false positives often means that the attacker will be able to proceed unhindered and unnoticed. Rather than ignoring certain security alerts, you need a better way to identify the FALSE NEGATIVES that could be buried in the noisy false positives.
 
THE SOLUTION:
DTonomy leverages patented AI technology to automatically and continuously group related alerts into attack progression stories while simultaneously tracking and enriching all alerts. Rather than closing the case on noisy false positives, DTonomy continuously monitors them and correlates them into cases. However, every feedback we learned from analysts or the environment will be taken into consideration by AI to lower its prioritization.
Even if certain alerts are mislabeled as false positives, do not worry. Our system will not filter out and ignore those alerts. Instead, we continue to monitor them and connect them with new detections that may lead to strong evidence of a TRUE POSITIVE for a group of alerts.

DTonomy takes potential FALSE NEGATIVE alerts and places them in “sleep mode”.  In the background, DTonomy automatically correlates new alerts to relevant cases. Once new evidence is discovered, DTonomy “wakes up” the case and prioritizes it with accumulated risk scores for additional investigation by the security team.
Eventually, DTonomy is looking for clear explanations and evidence for false positives. To facilitate this, DTonomy also provides on-demand security investigation services for your security alerts leveraging our AI-powered technology, automated user confirmation, and crowded noise intelligence.

                            Triage More Security Threats Faster                        
Security Alerts Fatigue
THE CHALLENGE:
Recent results from Forrester Research, show that the average security operation team receives 11,000+ alerts per day. These alerts consume 53% of the SOC team’s time to triage and investigate. About 33% of these alerts turn out to be false positives. SOC Analysts spend too much time manually investigating alerts to figure out what is going on, why it happened, and how to prevent it in the future. Even worse, SOC analysts are frustrated with an overwhelming number of security alerts and repetitive false positives, that each require time-consuming investigations. While companies have found SOAR tools useful for context enrichment when automated, these tools are not designed to discover new patterns from alerts nor built to learn decision rules that should be applied to reduce false positives. In addition to that, tweaking detection logic and tuning SOAR automation is a painful and risky process as well.
 
THE SOLUTION:
DTonomy’s AI-based cross-correlation and adaptive learning capabilities don’t only look for anomalies, instead, it looks for relationships between alerts. Too often atomic alerts are too noisy and not practical to start an investigation without proper correlation. Writing correlation rules manually is a time-consuming, never-ending task and limits the possibility of discovering new types of attacks. Additionally, as analysts triage security alerts, the analyst’s knowledge and processes are not captured, slowing down future resolution activities.  When security teams can correlate alerts and capture previous response activities, teams can use pattern analytics to enable you to triage security alerts much more efficiently. The DTonomy system ‘learns out’ false positive patterns based on security analysts’ activities. Doing this provides analysts with a smaller number of automatically-grouped alerts to review more efficiently.

Using a pattern-driven approach, true positives can be viewed quickly as being aligned with attack processes such as MITRE ATT&CK framework. Likewise, there are patterns exhibited by false positives as well.  For example, if you see multiple machines connecting to a single IP generating 100 alerts at the same time frame, or always aligning with certain deployment activity, that will give you confidence that they are false positives. DTonomy learns these patterns, enriches context for the alerts, ultimately helping to automatically identify both true positive and false positive much faster.

DTonomy uses AI algorithms to discover patterns that augment your manual correlation process
Trustworthy AI is used to ensure you are leveraging the power of AI confidently.

6 ChatGPT Use Cases for Streamlining Security Operations
Share This Post
As a highly capable AI language model, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way security teams approach their daily tasks. In this blog, we explore six creative ways that ChatGPT can assist and enhance the work of cybersecurity professionals, making their job easier and more effective.
1. Simplify SIEM Query Writing with ChatGPT
With ChatGPT, you can simply type in whatever you want in the blog.
ChatGPT makes it effortless to write SIEM queries, just type in your desired information and it will output the query for you.
As a demonstration, let’s examine a Splunk example:
Write a regular expression in Splunk to filter ip

Another example is generating a sentinel query.
Write a sentinel query to identify the number of active logon failures for users within 24 hour period.

2. Generate Security Detections
Using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to generate security detections can be done easily using ChatGPT.
Write ELK query to detect registry change

write a splunk query to detect command and control beaconing activity using subdomain DNS requests

3. Write Security Policies
Writing a comprehensive security policy can be a time-consuming and complex process. There are many elements to consider, such as risk assessments, threat modeling, incident response procedures, and more. However, by leveraging the power of advanced artificial intelligence technology, such as ChatGPT, this process can be simplified and streamlined. ChatGPT can assist in generating policy content, as well as assist in reviewing and refining existing policies, to ensure that they are up-to-date, comprehensive, and effective in protecting the organization.

4. Identify Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability management is a critical aspect of any organization’s cybersecurity strategy. Cyber criminals are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks that they can exploit to gain unauthorized access. The earlier a vulnerability is discovered, the easier it is to fix it. However, finding and fixing vulnerabilities can be a tedious and time-consuming process for IT teams, especially for large organizations with multiple systems and applications to manage. ChatGPT can be a useful tool to simplify this process. With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can assist IT teams in quickly identifying potential vulnerabilities and providing recommendations for remediation.
In the following example, we gave GPT code examples, and asked What’s wrong with this piece of code?
 
5. Write Automation Scripts for Daily Operations
Automation script is useful but writing automation scripts right takes time. With ChatGPT’s advanced capabilities, it can quickly generate code based on your requirements and reduce the amount of time you need to spend on writing scripts.
Generate a Powershell script for Malware scanning on a list of computers.

How does ChatGPT work? Tracing the evolution of AIGC.
Share This Post
AIGC, or AI-generated Content, is a way of content creation using artificial intelligence and is considered a new type of content creation after PGC (Professionally-generated Content) and UGC (User-generated Content). AIGC is developing rapidly in many fields such as text, image, and audio/video, software development, and in recent years there are many creation experience platforms that focus on AIGC, where users can input a sentence to let AI synthesize a picture associated with the description, or more commonly, input a description of an article, or just the beginning of a story, and let AI finish the article for you. It has broad applications wherever writing or content creation is needed such as writing a financial report, developing code, or creating sales/marketing materials. It can help people understand and analyze complex information faster, thus helping them make better decisions and generate significant value. These visions of productivity improvement are becoming a reality thanks to the advancement of technology. We’ve summarized the development of AIGC technology in the following chart and will elaborate on them in the following blogs. 
RNN Seq2Seq
For a long time, AIGC has been dominated by the RNN-based Seq2Seq model which consists of two RNN networks, with the first RNN being the encoder and the second RNN being the decoder. The quality of the text generated by RNN Seq2Seq is usually poor, often accompanied by grammatical errors or unclear semantics, mainly due to error transmission and amplification.
In 2017, the Transformer model structure was introduced and quickly gained popularity due to its ability to capture complex feature representations and its improved training efficiency compared to RNN models. As a result, a series of pre-training models were developed, which have become the leading AIGC technologies. The following section will provide an overview of these models. The Transformer model is particularly useful because it can process sequences in parallel, leading to a shift in the focus of text-writing algorithm research toward the Transformer model.
UniLM
UniLM, short for Unified Language Model, is a generative BERT model developed by the Microsoft Research Institute in 2019. Unlike traditional Seq2Seq models, it only utilizes BERT and does not have a Decoder component. It combines the training methods of several other models, such as L2R-LM (ELMo, GPT), R2L-LM (ELMo), BI-LM (BERT), and Seq2Seq-LM, hence the name “Unified” model.
UniLM’s pre-training is divided into three parts: Left-to-Right, Bidirectional, and Seq-to-Seq.
The difference between these three methods is only in the change of the Transformer’s mask matrix:
In the UniLM pre-training process, each of these three methods is trained for 1/3 of the time. Compared to the original BERT, the added unidirectional LM pre-training enhances the text representation ability, and the added Seq-to-Seq LM pre-training also enables UniLM to perform well in text generation/writing tasks.
T5
T5, whose full name is Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, is a model structure proposed by Google in 2020 with the general idea of using Seq2Seq text generation to solve all downstream tasks: e.g., Q&A, summarization, classification, translation, matching, continuation, denotational disambiguation, etc. This approach enables all tasks to share the same model, the same loss function, and the same hyperparameters.
The model structure of T5 is an Encoder-Decoder structure based on a multilayer Transformer. The main difference between T5 and the other models is that the GPT family is an autoregressive language model (AutoRegressive LM) containing only the Decoder structure, and BERT is a self-coding language model (AutoEncoder LM) containing only the Encoder.
The pre-training of T5 is divided into two parts, unsupervised and supervised.
The unsupervised part is the MLM method similar to BERT, except that BERT is masking a single word, while T5 is masking a segment of consecutive words, i.e., text span. the text span being masked is only replaced by a single mask character, i.e., the sequence length of the mask is also unknown for the post-mask text. In the Decoder part, only the text span of the mask is output, and the other words are replaced by the set <X>, <Y>, and <Z> symbols uniformly. This has three advantages, one is that it increases the difficulty of pre-training, obviously predicting a continuous text span of unknown length is a more difficult task than predicting a single word, which also makes the text representation capability of the trained language model more universal and more adaptable to fine-tuning on poor quality data; the second is that for the generation task the output sequence is of unknown length, and the pre-training of T5 is well This pre-training task used in T5 is also known as CTR (Corrupted Text Reconstruction).
The supervised part uses the four major categories of tasks included in GLUE and SuperGLUE: machine translation, question and answer, summarization, and classification. The core of Fine-tune is to combine these datasets and tasks together as one task, and in order to achieve this it is thought to design a different prefix for each task, which is input together with the task text. For example, for the translation task, to translate “That is good.” from English to German, then “translate English to German: That is good. target: Das ist gut.” is entered for training, and “translate English to German: That is good. target:”, and the model output predicts “Das ist gut.”. where “translate English to German:” is the prefix added for this translation task.
BART
BART stands for Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers. It is a model structure proposed by Facebook in 2020. As its name suggests, it is a model structure that combines a bidirectional encoding structure with an auto-regressive decoding structure. The BART model structure absorbs the characteristics of the Bidirectional Encoder in BERT and the Left-to-Right Decoder in GPT, building on the standard Seq2Seq Transformer model, which makes it more suitable for text generation scenarios than BERT. At the same time, compared to GPT, it also has more bidirectional contextual context information. 
The pre-training task of BART adopts the basic idea of restoring the [noise] in the text. BART uses the following specific [noise]: 
It can be seen that compared to BERT or T5, BART tries various [noise] on the Encoder side, and the reason and purpose are also simple: 
GPT
GPT stands for Generative Pre-Training. It is an iterative pre-training model, and its family of main members includes the first-generation GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3, InstructGPT, and the currently popular ChatGPT. Here we introduce them one by one.
GPT-1
The first-generation GPT is a pre-trained language model proposed by OpenAI in 2018. Its birth was earlier than BERT, and its core idea is to perform generative pre-training learning based on a large amount of unannotated data, and then fine-tune it on specific tasks. Because it focuses on generative pre-training, the GPT model structure only uses the Decoder part of the Transformer, and its standard structure includes Masked Multi-Head Attention and Encoder-Decoder Attention. The pre-training task of GPT is SLM (Standard Language Model), which predicts the current position of the word based on the previous context (window), so it is necessary to retain the Mask Multi-Head Attention to block the following context of the word to prevent information leakage. Because the Encoder is not used, Encoder-Decoder Attention is removed from the GPT structure.
GPT-2
The problem with the first-generation GPT is that the fine-tuning downstream task lacks transferability and the Fine-Tuning layer is not shared. In order to solve this problem, OpenAI introduced a new member of the GPT family in 2019: GPT-2. 
The learning goal of GPT-2 is to use an unsupervised pre-trained model to do a supervised task. Compared to the first-generation GPT, GPT-2 has the following changes: 
GPT-3
In 2020, OpenAI further introduced GPT-3 based on GPT-2. GPT-3’s approach is simpler and rougher, and the overall structure and training goals of the model are similar to GPT-2, but GPT-3 increases the model size to 175 billion parameters (115 times larger than GPT-2) and uses 45TB of data for training. Thanks to the staggering number of parameters, GPT-3 can learn and predict using zero-sample and few-sample without gradient updates.
InstructGPT
The super large model GPT-3 has indeed achieved unprecedented results in generating tasks, especially in zero-sample and few-sample scenarios, but GPT-3 has faced a new challenge: the output of the model is not always useful, it may output results that are not real, harmful or reflect negative emotions. This phenomenon is understandable because the pre-trained task is a language model and the goal of pre-training is to maximize the likelihood of the output being natural language under the input constraints, without the requirement of “user needs safety and usefulness”. To solve this problem, in 2022 OpenAI published important research based on GPT-3: InstructGPT, introducing the technology of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
InstructGPT has not changed much from GPT-3 in terms of the model itself, the main change is in the training strategy. The overall idea is to have annotators provide demonstration answers for the call examples, and then use this data to fine-tune the model so that it can make more appropriate responses. Its training steps are divided into three steps:
The resulting InstructGPT is much better than GPT-3 in terms of following instructions, and also InstructGPT is less likely to make up facts out of thin air, with a small downward trend in the production of harmful outputs.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT, the latest research officially released by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, uses the same approach as InstructGPT, using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to train the model, with improvements in the data collection method (not specifically disclosed).
As can be seen, the training process of ChatGPT is consistent with that of InstructGPT, the difference is that InstructGPT fine-tunes on GPT-3, while ChatGPT fine-tunes on GPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5 is a model trained by OpenAI in Q4 2021 with strong ability in automatic code writing).
Throughout the development from the first-generation GPT to ChatGPT, OpenAI has proved that using super large data to train super large models, the resulting pre-trained language model is sufficient to handle various downstream tasks of natural language understanding and natural language generation, even without fine-tuning, and can still handle zero/few-sample tasks. In terms of the safety and controllability of the output, OpenAI’s answer is based on human-powered reinforcement learning: hiring 40 full-time annotators to work for nearly 2 years (the annotation time was not officially disclosed, the author only inferred from the roughly two and a half years interval between GPT-3 and ChatGPT, because reinforcement learning requires continuous iteration) to provide annotation feedback for the model’s output, and only with this data can reinforcement learning be performed to guide the optimization of the model. Transformer + super large data + super large model + massive human power + reinforcement learning has created the phenomenal ChatGPT of today.

Cyber Security Dashboard
Share This Post
A cybersecurity dashboard is a graphical user interface that displays real-time data about the security of an organization’s network and systems. It typically includes a collection of metrics, charts, and other visualizations that provide a high-level view of an organization’s cybersecurity posture. The dashboard may include information about the number of attacks, the types of attacks, the systems that were targeted, and the success or failure of those attacks. Some dashboards may also include alerts or notifications about potential security incidents or vulnerabilities. The purpose of a cybersecurity dashboard is to give security analysts and other stakeholders a quick and easy way to monitor the security of their network and systems and to take action if necessary.
Security-specific tech solutions often display data that is very technical and doesn’t provide a complete picture of risk. This can be challenging for less-technically skilled individuals on the board and in the C-suite who are responsible for cybersecurity oversight. To help these individuals better understand and communicate cyber risks, it can be useful to provide more straightforward, aggregated information that is easy for everyone to understand.
We have compiled a list of cyber risk KPIs under a few categories that can be integrated into a dashboard for any member of an organization who wants to become more aware of cyber risk. These metrics come from a variety of sources and cover a range of risks, including technical issues, security diligence, and human behavior.
1. Security Posture rating/Benchmark 
Security posture refers to the overall level of security protection that an organization has in place to defend against potential threats and vulnerabilities. It would be good to compare your security posture with industries and identify gaps. 
To achieve this, you could summarize the discovered issues below or request third-party service to provide a benchmark report.  
2. Assets
Show the list of assets that are under your coverage. For example, the number of 
3.  Incident & Detection & Response 
Show the metrics related to security operations. 
You may also want to highlight a few notable incidents and top users/machines that have the most issues. Be prepared with metrics along a timeline so that you can reveal the trend, and the needs and guide the planning. 
4. Vulnerabilities
5. Compliance & Audit
It is also worth adding a few specific controls addressing threats such as Ransomware
6. Security Training 
7. Cost & Value 
Keep cost and value in your monitoring/reporting when needed. 
Referring to cost, there are two parts. 
Regarding Value, focus on $ saved/loss prevented.

How to run an effective phishing test?
Share This Post
Phishing attacks are a common method used by hackers to gain access to sensitive information, and they can be very difficult to detect. By conducting regular phishing tests, organizations can help protect themselves against these attacks by identifying and addressing any vulnerabilities in their employees’ security knowledge and practices.
To run an effective phishing test, there are several key steps you should follow:
1. Identify the goals of your phishing test.
This will help you tailor the test to your specific needs and ensure that you are able to measure its effectiveness. Here are a few common phishing themes
Based on your company’s primary business, make sure the relevant phishing themes are fully tested.  
2. Choose the right software or service to conduct the test.
There are many options available, so it’s important to research and compare different options to find the one that best fits your needs.
3. Create a realistic phishing email.
The email should be designed to look like a legitimate message from a trusted source, such as a colleague or a known company. It should also contain a link or attachment that will allow you to track who clicks on it.
A popular example is to convert any phishing email you’ve received to simulated phishing with a few changes. 
 
For example, if you want to use LinkedIn as a phishing site:
The software can clone the website and make one similar to it. 
4. Send the email to a selected group of employees.
This group should be representative of the broader organization and should include a mix of different job roles and levels of technical expertise.
5. Track the results of the test.
This will typically involve monitoring who clicks on the link or attachment, as well as any other relevant metrics such as the time it takes for employees to report the phishing attempt.
6. Analyze the results and take action.
Once you have collected and analyzed the data from the test, you should use it to identify any areas where your employees are particularly susceptible to phishing attacks and take steps to address those vulnerabilities. This may include providing additional training or implementing new security measures.
By following these steps, you can run an effective phishing test that will help you assess the security of your organization and identify areas where you can improve.
When you are ready, here are three ways we can help

Synchronize siloed security services with ConnectWise
Share This Post
MSPs & ConnectWise
ConnectWise Manage is a popular professional service automation(PSA) software that MSPs (managed service providers) use to manage the services they are offering. It has covered many aspects of running an MSP including sales/marking/contract management/finance/project/ticket etc. all in one place.
As more and more MSPs start offering cybersecurity services,  a few things may prevent MSPs to scale up quickly, for example, billing, or for example, communicating values/progress clearly backed by numbers & charts with clients monthly or quarterly. 
This post shows how you can use automation to unblock this. The example we are showing is one of the most important ones: fix the billing for your security service by synchronizing siloed customers’ subscription information with ConnectWise in an automated way. More specifically, as shown below, you could see CrowdStrike Service added to your ConnectWise agreement as an addition with aggregated host installation information. 
Risks
Without automation in place, you have to check this information for each tenant monthly and update ConnectWise manually which is error-prone. It works when you have fewer than 5 clients but will quickly become a cumbersome task when you have a few more customers. 

Benefit
With automation in place, 
This post uses CrowdStrike as an example. CrowdStrike has different licenses and is using a different naming schema compared with ConnectWise. For example, CrowdStrike has a field called “CID” while ConnectWise does not.  A good practice is to use a table to store this customer information, for example, Power BI, to maintain consistent security services subscriptions by customers. With all of them in place, we can chain them together to automatically consolidate your CrowdStrike bills in ConnectWise.
Data Pipeline architecture 
Three tools are involved in this automation. Power BI, ConnectWise, and CrowdStrike. Power BI is used to store customer information. CrowdStrike has installed hosts for each client. Both information will be retrieved and correlated to update ConnectWise. 

APIs
To achieve automation, you need to leverage three APIs from these three tools. 
#1. CrowdStrike API to pull host information
This API enables you to query host information so that you can start to get accurate host information. 

#2. Power BI API to pull your customer information
Use Power BI as one way to store your extra customer meta information. An alternative solution could be a database or Sharepoint. 

#3: ConnectWise API to append additions to the agreement. 
This API enables you to update your agreement with updated CrowdStrike Installation numbers for each tenant. 

End-to-end automation 
Built on top of three APIs, we can now start creating end-to-end automation. 
1. Connector with CrowdStrike
Configure CrowdStrike Connectors to retrieve host information. 

2. Connector with Power BI 
Configure Power BI Connectors to retrieve Customer meta information. 

3. Connector with ConnectWise 
Configure ConnectWise Connectors to update additions in agreement. 

4. End-to-end workflow
Once connected, a full end-to-end workflow is like this. Additional nodes are added in between connectors to fill in the gap in data transformations. 

Click the trigger (the first node), you will see the target agreement is updated with the aggregated counts of hosts. 

Billing consolidation for other tools
The playbooks can be easily adjusted to integrate with other tools or services you are currently providing, such as Office 365. If there are any particular integrations you would like to consolidate as well, please let us know.
Look for other integrations?
DTonomy’s platform has 100s integrations with various kinds of tools. Check it out here. If it is not there, just reach out to us. We are continuously adding more integrations. 
With more integrations, you can now perform various kinds of different automation.

Create vulnerability summary report using Power BI
Share This Post
A vulnerability scanner enables organizations to monitor their networks, systems, and applications for security vulnerabilities. Most security teams utilize vulnerability scanners to find weaknesses in their environment and make sure preventive actions are taken properly beforehand. The number of vulnerabilities in IT systems is growing fast every day. Over 8,000 vulnerabilities are reported in Q1 of 2022.  Popular vulnerability scanners include CrowdStrike falcon spotlight, Rapid 7, Tenable, ShadowServer, Qualys, etc. To make sure vulnerabilities are timely patched, one important part is to make sure they are visible to the parties that are relevant. For example, your management team and your clients. Popular business intelligence tools such as Power BI is a great tool to achieve this. In this post, we outline the process to quickly build up an automation to create a Power BI report on the summary of vulnerabilities based on Crowd Strike Falcon Spotlight vulnerability information. 
CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight
CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight offers security teams a real-time assessment of vulnerability exposure on their endpoints. It collects endpoint vulnerability data based on a single agent provided by crowd strike. 
Power BI
Power BI is a popular business intelligence tool provided by Microsoft. Teams can use Power BI to create and share nice dashboard and report within a team or for clients. 
Comparing other dashboard solutions e.g. SIEM, Power BI is 
Data Transformation 
Before you create a nice report for your customers or share it between teams, you will need to stitch crowd-strike vulnerability information together in the desired format so that you can use it to build the report. The following shows an automated solution that you can reuse to stitch vulnerability data from CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight to Power BI. It is an out-of-the-box solution and you can reuse it almost immediately. 

CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight APIs 
CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight has two APIs
This API returns a list of vulnerability IDs. However, it does not provide vulnerability details. In order to take CrowdStrike details, you will need to use another API to complete the requests. 
      2. Get vulnerability details 
This API returns vulnerability details based on a vulnerability id or a list of vulnerability ids.
Power BI API
To post rows to Power BI, you will need to use Power BI API to post data row by row. 

End-to-end data pipeline automation
The output of CrowdStrike is a JSON Object which contains a list of information. To transform it, you will need to map that to a table schema in Power BI.  DTonomy’s end-to-end automation for pulling data from CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight and stitching them together is here:
Retrieve data from CrowdStrike Falcon:
Fill in CrowdStrike Connection Information and then pull vulnerability Ids. The CrowdStrike API Connection Information can be found on CrowdStrike Instance. 
Once you have a list of vulnerabilities, let’s retrieve vulnerability details. 
Data Transformation:
The function node in between Vulnerability Details and the Power BI node is the transformation where you can transform data or enrich data or customize data to the format you would like to send 
Upload data to Power BI: 
Select the post rows to function under datasets operation and also include your desired workspace id and Power BI credentials to upload transformed data to Power BI
This takes the transformed data and then uploads it to Power BI. 
Fully automated workflow 
An end-to-end automated data pipeline is like this. 
Step 1: pull all vulnerabilities from CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight
Step 2: based on vulnerability ids, pull vulnerability details
Step 3: transform and select vulnerability information to table format
Step 4: Upload data to Power BI 
Once automated, you can schedule it to run every day or every week. Based on updated data, you can easily create a nice vulnerability summary report like this. 
We provide different types of templates that can be reused for different reports purpose.  
Share your report
From Power BI, you can now easily share reports with your client or your other team members. 

 
Aggregated vulnerabilities on multiple different tools
It is very common you may have multiple scanners besides CrowdStike Spotlight, for example, Tenable, Rapid7, etc. With the flexible integrations, now we can easily dedupe the vulnerabilities and provide a unified view on vulnerabilities.  
 
Multi-Tenant Vulnerability Management 
Managing CrowdStrike in multi-tenant environments can be challenging and risky when it comes to retrieving vulnerability information. Instead of using a separate API key for each tenant, our solution allows you to easily authorize access using a parent API key and tenant customer id. By doing so, you can generate a token for each tenant and retrieve vulnerability information in a secure and efficient manner.

Prevent Email Spoofing with SPF, DKIM and DMARC
Share This Post
Email spoofing is one of the common techniques used by phishing attacks. By using different techniques, attackers trick users to think the email is from legitimate parties.  To combat email spoofing, a few mechanisms have been invented – Namely DMARC, DKIM & SPF. However many times the terms are confusing. In this blog, we will cover the details of email spoofing and provide an explanation of SPF,  DKIM, and DMARC. Here is an outline:
Let’s start with an understanding of how the email system works.
1. Email system behind the scene
When you send out an email, the email system actually takes a few more steps than you would see on your email client. Here is an example of a set of actions when you send an email.
2. Email Spoofing
As permitted by SMTP, you can actually
This sounds crazy, right? But these are intentional designs by SMTP but sadly abused by attackers for malicious purposes, namely email spoofing.
In general, there are three types of email spoofing.
Typically when attackers spoof the real email address, the attacker may use one of the following options
3. Prevent/Detect email spoofing
There are a few mechanisms in place for the security team to prevent email spoofing.
3.1 Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
SPF is a DNS record a domain owner publishes that contains a list of servers from which they send emails. When the receiver receives the domain, it checks the list of legitimate sources and if the server it comes from is not on the list, it knows it is not legitimate.
An SPF record looks something like this:
SPF is useful to protect against MailFrom spoofing which is good for your company and your domain brand as well.  However it only concerns the MailFrom address, and does not protect the header from or display name spoofing
3.2 DomainKeys Identified Mail(DKIM)
DKIM is a key-pair signing mechanism for the header of mail messages. When you send mail you attach a signature to the message using a private key which is compared to a public key published in DNS for your domain. DKIM adds authenticity to a message and guards against tampering with the header by downstream mail servers.
DKIM is a signature, adding a layer of authenticity. However, if an email does not have a DKIM, it does not mean it is malicious.
3.3 Domain Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)
DMARC’s conformance check(“alignment”) checks that the header from is “aligned” with other authenticated domains on the message either via DKIM or SPF. If either DKIM or SPF alignment passes DMARC evaluates as a “PASS.”
SPF Alignment: The domain in the header from and envelope MAIL from must be the same (or sub-domains of the same parent domain if “relaxed”) and must pass SPF.
DKIM Alignment: DMARC requires a valid signature where the domain specified in the d= tag aligns with the sender’s domain from the header from the field.
However
DMARC alignment is only enforced when your policy (p=) is set to “reject” or “quarantine”.
Lots of receiving mail servers still do not evaluate DMARC, evaluate only for reporting, or evaluate but don’t report
4. The caveats of SPF/DKIM/DMARC
You can see SPF is useful for envelopes Mail from spoofing, DMARC + SPF + DKIM can help the header from spoofing. However, they do not address display name spoofing or other email spoofing issues such as using a compromised email account. More advanced email behavior rules are needed to prevent/detect another email spoofing. Moreover, it is up to senders to configure their SPF. The sender may configure or not which is not under your control.  Therefore we can not rely on SPF/DKIM/DMARC to detect phishing. They are important metrics but are not enough.

6 things you should include in your client security dashboard
Share This Post
Client dashboards and reports are important to the community and the business value. When creating such metrics/dashboards, what is the strategy that can maximize your values? What kind of metrics you should include in your dashboard? Typically the report is mostly sent to a manager in your clients, so the information has to be precise, and high level but not overwhelming, meanwhile it should contain enough information to show your value. 
In this blog, we have outlined a few metrics that you should show in your dashboard/report. 
      1. Security Posture/Benchmark  
Especially on the security side, clients are appreciating an overwhelming security posture score whether comparing with your other clients or providing a scoring based on your own measurement mechanism. Since there are complexities involved in security, a high-level security score will give customers a clear impression. 
     2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Show KPIs that enable customers to track the business progress. Based on your terms with your clients,  here are a few for your consideration: 
      3. Assets 
Show the list of assets that are under your coverage. For example, the number of 
      4. Vulnerabilities & your patches 
List the number of vulnerabilities you’ve discovered. You can break it down by 
Also, track your progress by showing how many are patched and how many are not. 
       5. Detections & your resolutions
List the number of detections your monitoring solution has discovered and how many you have resolved. You can simply break it down into a few top categories: 
      6. Incidents 
List the number of real incidents that have happened and need their attention. 
 
AI-based metrics 
Most metrics can be easily extracted from data directly. Some are not straightforward. Here are two more AI-based metrics that can make your customers impressive:
Trend:
What is the prediction for tickets next month? 
Root cause:
What’s the major root cause of those tickets or alerts? What are the big issues that your customers need to be aware of?  
These are deep insights that can be further distilled from your data intelligently to impress your clients.

Risk based Alerting
Share This Post
Security operations centers (SOC) are incredibly noisy places. They experience hundreds of thousands of security alerts daily. 1% are urgent and very likely to be true attacks. 30% of alerts are false positives. The rest of 69% are either information, nonactionable, or take time to completely identify as false positives or true positives. Either tweaking them which could generate more false positives or ignoring them which put the company at risk. Despite every alert coming with a default score, they are not well prioritized nor calculated based on your context, therefore wasting resources on trivial risks and slowing down responses to important risks.
 
Risk-based Alerting 
Instead of looking at atomic alerts, let’s look at aggregate risks over a group of alerts and alert over them once the aggregated risk exceeds thresholds.  According to the famous risk formula: 
RISK =  probability x loss
On the Probability side, here are a few factors to measure:
One the Loss side
Quantify the risks
Once laying down the affecting factors, you can start to qualify them. For example: 
Eventually, summarize all factor scores in probability and all factor scores for loss. The multiply of both is the final risk score.  
Alerting 
Set up a threshold for alerting based on the final risks. 

Benefits
Reality Check:
RBA does save time as the fact that it correlates alerts. The very tricky part is that you now have to tune all those factors and decide which factor is important that requires continuous tuning. And these scores are very arbitrary. Without normalization, it is hard to compare one-to-one with one threshold value. (think about comparing apple vs bear). Normalization is a learning and fine-tuning process that takes time. Besides, legit users/machines still do weird stuff which can not be ruled out by RBA. For example, legit software triggers Mimikatz or uses encoded Powershell. In RBA, all these will trigger high critical alerts and bump up the scores.
Why does this happen? 
It is because your risk score is not accurate. 
The aggregated risk score is based on a simple aggregation of static factors. However, there are lots of dynamic factors that could make risky stuff less risky in your environment. For example, a detection turns out to be more likely noisy; something that is less uncommon in your environment, etc. These types of dynamic changing factors need to be continuously learned/updated to mitigate the pitfalls of RBA and set you back in the right direction.

Eight factors you should evaluate when prioritizing security alerts
Share This Post
Quantifying and scoring individual security alert are important for security teams to effectively prioritize security tasks. Common scoring mechanisms are the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). It is an open framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities, owned and managed by FIRST.Org. NIST publishes the Base metrics in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with a score ranging from 0 to 10. However, each organization needs to modify the CVSS by their local Temporal and Environmental metrics. 
CVSS is a good framework for scoring vulnerabilities, which is part of the security alerts that the SOC team has to process, however it is not suitable for generic security alerts. Security detection vendors like to categorize the severity of security alerts into low, medium, and high based on the credibility of the detections they created. However, most of them are not accurate to each one’s environment. Incorrect scoring for security alerts 
especially valuable for security teams who have already been busy with other tasks. 
With proper prioritization, the security team
 
Eight Factors
After working with a few security teams for a while, we’ve summarized a few factors that you need to consider when prioritizing your security alerts:
Challenges:
To successfully implement the prioritization for your security alerts, we see there are two challenges 
But if implemented, you will see the significant time saving on investigations, proper resource allocations, and faster remediation of important things. Those factors are the things you need to check anyways, why not automate? Automating it will set you up a baseline for accurate prioritization.
 
AI-based scoring:
Fixed scoring requires continuous tuning which is time-consuming. The score will drift because it does not update automatically to reflect the changes in your environment. AI-based scoring, which learns from your feedback and learns to distinguish true important alerts from false positives, will continuously learn and update the scores based on the feedback, further saving your time on tuning.

Start detecting Leaked Secrets on Darkweb in 10 minutes
Share This Post
The deep web, also known as the dark web, is a part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines and is therefore not accessible to most users. It is often associated with illegal activities, such as the sale of drugs and weapons, and is therefore sometimes referred to as the “dark side” of the internet.
The deep web is not a single entity, but rather a collection of networks and websites that are not accessible via traditional web browsers and search engines. These networks and websites are often hidden behind anonymous networks such as TOR, and can only be accessed using specialized software and tools.
One of the key features of the deep web is its anonymity and lack of centralization. This makes it difficult for law enforcement agencies and other organizations to monitor and control the activities that take place on the deep web, and has contributed to its reputation as a hub for illegal activities.
Overall, the deep web is a complex and largely mysterious part of the internet, and its true nature and extent are difficult to fully understand. While it is often associated with illegal activities, it also serves as a platform for a range of legitimate purposes, such as providing a space for political dissidents and other marginalized groups to communicate and share information.
It is generally difficult to detect leaked secrets on the deep web, as this part of the internet is not indexed by search engines and is therefore not accessible to most users. In order to access the deep web, users need to use specialized software and tools, such as the TOR network, and must know the specific addresses of the networks and websites they wish to access.
However, there are some general steps that organizations can take to try to detect leaked secrets on the deep web. Some of these steps include:
Monitor social media and other public forums: Many users of the deep web will post information or discuss their activities on social media and other public forums. By monitoring these forums, organizations may be able to detect leaked secrets or other sensitive information.
Use specialized tools and services: There are a number of specialized tools and services that can help organizations to monitor the deep web for leaked secrets. These tools often use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of data from the deep web and to identify potential leaks or other security issues.
Work with law enforcement: In some cases, organizations may be able to work with law enforcement agencies to detect and investigate leaked secrets on the deep web. These agencies may have access to specialized tools and expertise that can help to identify and track activities on the deep web.
 In this blog, we are focusing on how we can detect leaked information by monitor social media or public forum.
Hackers are selling stolen information via online services all the time. Here are a few popular websites that are used for exchanging leaked information:
As security analysts who are protecting the company’s assets, we are always concerned if there are any leaked information is exchanged by hackers via these online services. Therefore we would like to figure out a way to detect relevant leaked information exchanged online. This blog describes how we use DTonomy to quickly set up an automation to detect relevant leaking so that we can take remediation actions quickly. 
 
Pastebin
Pastebin (https://pastebin.com) is a populate paste tool service that people copy & paste random stuff on for temporary storage. Researchers also found out it’s a popular destination for hackers to dump the secrets they have just stolen, such as usernames & passwords. The following blog describes how to develop an automated workflow on DTonomy platform to detect potential secret leaks from your organization automatically.
 
Automation
Step 1: 
You can sign up for a subscription service from Pastebin to send you an alert email whenever it detects a potential secret leak that’s of your concern, based on the regex rules you had set up.

Step 2: 
The workflow in DTonomy starts with an “Email” that monitors the inbox that you have set up to receive the Pastebin alerts and retrieves the alert email whenever get a new one.

Step 3: 
You need a “extractUrl” node to extra all the hyperlinks from the alert email. 

Step 4: 
Filter out the hyperlink list and only keep the ones that have a Pastebin url. The regex rule you can use is “pastebin.com|pastr.io”

Step 5: 
Use “http request” node to retrieve the html content of each Pastebin url you have parsed from the previous step.

Step 6: 
Use the regex rule to find out if there’s any mention of your organization’s domain. For example, if your organization’s domain is xyz.com, you can use the following regex rule:
This regex rule finds any username/password that matches your organization’s domain

Step 7: 
Last step you can decide what to do with the leaked secrets. For example, you can check your organization’s identity management system, freeze the compromised accounts, and send an alert to both the individual and your network admins.
 
Now you have an automation set up to start detecting leaked information for you tirelessly.

Open ports? Detect and respond with automation!
Share This Post
Hackers are constantly scanning networks and trying to get in via vulnerability exposed via open ports. Therefore, it is important to understand what are the open ports within your network and how to deal with them if there are any open ports. Some ports are required to open for providing service and some are needed to be investigated. As security teams are managing thousands of devices, it becomes only possible to manage these types of risks with automation.  Luckily, third-party services such as ShadowServer can assist scan the network on a continuous basis and sending you the report. Once received, a quick way to address these types of risks is to figure out whether there are any new open ports showing up within your network. If new ports showed up, you can reach out to the relevant people for investigation. In this blog, we will show you how to leverage DTonomy’s automation to fulfill this task.
 
Process: 
Get ShadowServer RDP Scan Reports
In your workflow, first you need to configure a ShadowServer Report node to retrieve all the RDP open ports’ report IDs as follows: 
  
You need to pass input to this node as follows:
  “reports”: [ “united-states”, “california”  ],
  “type”: “scan_rdp”,
  “limit”: 2
}
“reports” are the list of report types you have access to, which you should change according to your own situations.
“type” is “scan_rdp” for this topic.
“limit” is the number of most recent reports you wanna download
The returned results will be a list of entries such as:
  “id”: “-ftVDslHX_hl4grdml_p859FZvc?MerpjjUB9YIgDihWYLpXTw”,
  “type”: “scan_rdp”,
  “file”: “2022-05-21-scan_rdp-california_system-asn.csv”,
  “timestamp”: “2022-05-21”,
  “report”: [ “united-states”, “california”  ]
}
From this entry, you’ll get the specific report IDs that you’ll need to download corresponding detailed reports.
Still use the same ShadowServer Report node, but configure it to get specific report by ID as follows:

You need to pass input to this node as follows:
  “id”: “-ftVDslHX_hl4grdml_p859FZvc?MerpjjUB9YIgDihWYLpXTw”,
  “limit”: 3
}
“id” is the report ID you retrieved from the previous node
“limit” is the number of records that will be returned
From the downloaded detailed report, you’ll get the list of IP addresses that have an RDP port opened for the given date range
Archive Scan Results to an External Data Storage
Suppose you want to archive the results to a permanent data storage, so you can compare the new results with the old results, then find the delta between them.
There’re many options in DTonomy:

    2. You can save them to a file in local file storage

     3. You can save them to a SQL Database

Compare the New Results to the Previous Archived Results
Now you have the new result and old result, you want to calculate the delta between them, thus finding out what’re the newly opened RDP ports. You can write your own logic w/ Function Node, or PythonFunction node. Or better yet, you can use the built-in Jsdiff Node as follows:

In this case, you want to calculate the diff between an array of old IP addresses and an array of new IP addresses. Thus you only need to set msg.targetObject to “diffArrays”, and set msg.oldValue & msg.newValue to corresponding old & new IP addresses.
Summary
By now, you have an automated workflow that continuously monitors your open ports, especially the changes of open ports in your network so that we can route investigation requests to the team at right time.

Create a Red and Blue Team HomeLab
Share This Post
A SOC team usually has a red team and a blue team. It is always a good idea to practice TTPs(techniques, tactics, procedures), generate IOCs so that you can understand how an attack works and what noise it generates, and set up automation to start practicing analyzing and responding to these issues, with the aim to learn how to respond to security threats faster. 
In this blog, we will walk you through a few tools and guide you on how to set up a home lab for both the red team and the blue team. 
Red Team:
Blue Team: 
Lab Setup: A Kali Linux VM acting as a C2C Server using Caldera and a Windows 10 VM as a victim with Caldera RAT agent and Splunk’s Monitoring agent (Splunk Universal Forwarder). Both the machines are connected via an internal network. Once set up, consolidate your security threats in DTonomy’s AIR platform and start automating all your defense operations.
 
Red Team- Attack Simulation: 
Caldera is a cyber security framework designed to easily run autonomous breach simulation exercises. It is used to automate adversary emulation and incident response. The core framework consists of an asynchronous command-and-control (C2) server with a REST API and a web interface. Caldera also supports plugins that expand the core framework capabilities and provides additional functionalities. Its main use is to test endpoint solutions.
Installing Caldera
Installing Caldera is a very straightforward process and should take around 10 minutes or less. Start by cloning the repository in the desired folder.
Navigate to the caldera folder and install all the requirements
From within the folder itself, start the Caldera Server GUI
Now, login to the Caldera Server GUI on http://localhost:8888 using the credentials, red: admin.
Establish Caldera agents
Caldera agents are Remote Access Tools (RATs), allowing to execution of benign commands which simulate adversarial behavior. Using the GUI navigate to agents and Add agents.
Now, select 54ndc47 (SandCat) as your agent and select the OS, add the host system’s IP address in-app.contact.http, and append port 8888 at the end (default listening port for Caldera). Then head over to the Victim machine/Endpoint. For windows, paste the command in PowerShell (admin privileges are optional) and for Ubuntu/Debian paste the command in the terminal.
Launch an Adversarial Operation
Now, we have everything ready to carry out our Adversarial attacks using Caldera. It has many pre-defined Adversarial Plans which are just to get us to understand the system. The best ones to start are “The Discovery” or “The Hunter”.
From the menu navigate to “Operations”, and toggle the switch to “Add”. Type a name for the operation. Under the basic operations, select the adversary plan and change “Keep open forever” to “Auto close operation”. Press Start to begin your attack.
Now let’s get started setting up the blue team tool. 
Blue Team Setup: 
Network monitoring set up(PfSense)
pfSense is a free and open-source operating system for routers and firewalls. pfSense can be installed on most commodity hardware, including old computers and embedded systems. 
Follow the instruction here to set up pfSense. 
Once pfSense is done, you can quickly configure  Suricata to start detecting attacks on pfSense. Suricata is an open-source detection engine that can act as intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system. pfSense has a Suricata module, which you can install quickly and start detecting. 
Follow the instructions here to enable Suricata on pfSense. 
 
See detections in SIEM
Leverage Splunk freemium version to set up an instance. You can install Splunk’s Monitoring agent ( Splunk Universal Forwarder) to forward detections to view in Splunk. (Set up forwarder here Universal Forwarder for Remote Data Collection)
Once installed, you can start to see Detections in Splunk

Manage and respond to security threats automatically via DTonomy AIR
DTonomy AIR enables consolidating security threats, streamlining security investigation and response, and automates security operations.  Sign up DTonomy freemium edition here. 
Here we will set up an automation to automatically block an IP once an alert is triggered. 
Set up DTonomy connector to Splunk
The first step is to pull security alerts from different tools, endpoints, networks, etc. Here let’s configure the DTonomy connector to pull all threats from Splunk.  

Then, let’s set up a workflow to block IP in pfSense. 
The automatic command to block IP via pfSense is here:  (Reference is here)
Since you are using DTonomy in the cloud, let’s use an SSH node to connect to your local instance and type in this command in the SSH node to block your IP automatically once detection is triggered. 

Now you have a full end-to-end home lab set up and ready to run your home security experiment. 
Stay tuned. More on threat hunting, detection, investigation, and response!

Integrating CrowdStrike API to Automate Security Investigation and Response with No Code
Share This Post
The CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform provides protection on critical areas of enterprise risk including endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data. Its Endpoint Detection and Response capabilities not only provide alerts on discovered threats but also provide a holistic view of threats and intelligence across all the hosts. Therefore, it is very useful for the security team to leverage CrowdStrike API to automate security tasks such as investigation, response, and report. In this blog, we will cover
Top 3 Security Automation Use Cases with CrowdStrike API:
Security analysts have implemented quite a few automation use cases related to CrowdStrike, for example:
CrowdStrike API Functionalities:
CrowdStrike has a set of APIs supporting functionalities like
Connect To CrowdStrike: 
CrowdStrike is using OAuth2 for API Integration authentication. OAuth2 is an industry-standard Specification. It provides a time-sensitive token once the client sends the server the client Id and the client secrete. 
To connect to the CrowdStrike API server, You will need to specify API URL, Client Id, and Client Secret. 
You can find Client ID, Client Secret on Falcon Console. 
Once you fill in this information on the UI, you will be able to connect to CrowdStrike API server and trigger actions. 
 
Orchestrate CrowdStrike with Other Products for Security Automation
Security analysts are leveraging CrowdStrike API to achieve automation such as use cases listed on 1. In order to orchestrate CrowdStrike actions with another platform, you will need to take a few steps to make them start talking. 
Let’s take a look at “get host Info” action on CrowdStrike.
Besides specifying Server for connection,  you will need to specify Input and Output. 
In this particular use case, input is the hostId and output is detailed host info. You can either specify hostId directly on the panel or retrieve it from the previous node (or products in the upstream workflow). You do not need to write any code here. Once executed, you will see the results on the right panel. 
 
End to End Use Case Example:
Here is an example of end-to-end automation for creating reporting for CrowdStrike detections and threat intelligence on PowerBI. It pulls detections from CrowdStrike and updates your PowerBI workspace automatically. So, you will always get refreshed data sets in PowerBI for reporting.  
Check out more details here.

Microsoft Power BI and Google Data Studio
Both Microsoft Power BI and Google Data Studio are two robust data analytics tools that can help you visualize raw and complex data. Their easy-to-understand user interfaces are good options for creating reports and sharing them with your manager or colleagues.
Create Security Reporting Dashboard
Security teams are constantly required to report security metrics for team communication and upper management. However, security teams are interacting with siloed data from virtually all the software that the company may use. Therefore, it is a painful process for the security team(managers) to manually collect data from different places to build up a report periodically.
Check out the example security metrics dashboard and reports here

Now with DTonomy’s hundreds of integrations including CrowdStrike, Tenable, Office365, Splunk, Power BI, etc., you can ensure automated and consistent data reports for your overall security posture report on your favorite data analytics tool.
Following is an example of creating a report on Power BI for your CrowdStrike data.
Once set up, you can start seeing data flowing from CrowdStrike to Power BI continuously.

Role-based access control for reports and details 
CrowdStrike has an easy way for you to TAG the detections and vulnerabilities. Through automation, you can easily route the information to different groups to ensure relevant groups have access to their own information and each group will only be able to view relevant reports. 
Single Pane of Glass for Different Security Metrics
You may have multiple security tools. Some for user information, some for active directory, some for vulnerability, and some for office 365. And you look to consolidate multiple different metrics in one report? Yes. That is what Power BI is good at. Different data in different Power BI tables can be used to create one report.  (Example here)
Security Reporting Via Excel Spreadsheet
Excel spreadsheet is a great data analysis tool, However, Using an Excel spreadsheet for security reporting can be problematic for several reasons. Some of the main drawbacks of using Excel for security reporting include:
Limited data analysis capabilities: Excel is primarily a spreadsheet program, and it does not have the same range of data analysis and visualization tools as dedicated security reporting tools. This can make it difficult to gain insights from security data and identify potential trends or issues.
Limited data sources: Excel is not designed to connect to and integrate data from multiple sources which makes it difficult to create comprehensive security reports that provide a complete view of an organization’s security posture.
Limited collaboration and sharing: Excel does not include tools for collaboration and sharing, such as the ability to share reports and to discuss and comment on data. This can make it difficult for teams to collaborate on security reporting and to share insights and findings.
Overall, using an Excel spreadsheet for security reporting can be problematic and can limit an organization’s ability to gain insights from its security data.

Bridge the gap between security detection and response
Share This Post
The evolution of the Security Operation Center (SOC)
Security Information and Event Management Platforms (SIEM) have gradually become the center of SOC operations. They create different and relevant security detections/alerts that security analysts have to evaluate. Usually, a tier 1 analyst performs the initial triage of SIEM alerts and escalates high-priority ones to tier 2 or tier 3 for more thorough threat hunting. Tier 2 and 3 analysts will use additional tools such as centralized log management and analytics platform to hunt for anomalous activity that could date back months. The goal is to identify which actions the SOC team should take now, how to stop a breach and how to prevent one in the future.
To assist the SOC team in quickly investigating and responding to security issues, new tools like Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) assist security analysts on a daily basis to automate repetitive tasks. While it is great to automate lots of low-level tasks and has great potential, it also comes with a few challenges. Primarily, security analysts have to know what to automate. For example, “if there are too many brute force logins, then lock down account” is not effective automation. Analysts are reluctant to automate these responses because they lack confidence in the analysis and subsequent automation activity.
The gap between Detection and Response
The gap between detection and response characterizes the manual effort required by security analysts to investigate each alert in order to either dismiss it as false positive or consolidate the details of an attack to remediate it accurately.
When a security alert arrives, a security analyst will ask…
Security teams are constantly facing these challenges. Unfortunately, their ability to review each alert and fully investigate potential threats is limited by the time-consuming effort that each alert requires. Consequently, security teams ignore early threat activity, only triaging high priority alerts which increases the risk of missing attacks. What’s more, in a recent report by Forrester Research, on average, internal security operations teams receive over 11,000 alerts per day and more than 50% are false positives. Analysts’ time is wasted chasing “false positives” and manual operations. It causes “alert fatigue,” a common experience in SOC centers.
Measure the damage of Alert fatigue
Many companies and organizations have experienced alert fatigue. What is the right way to measure the damage properly? Here are a few factors that we should take into consideration when measuring the damage caused by alert fatigue.
If breached, the average cost of an incident is around $3.86 million dollars according to a report from IBM. Not to mention the Kaseya hackers demanded $70 million ransom and Colonial Pipeline paid a $5 million ransom to the attackers.
You can easily calculate the wasted time on investigating false positives which could be spent on important tasks instead. The more time they spend fixing false alerts, the less your organization benefits from their talent and experience.
Eventually, employees may wear out due to the number of alerts they need to address. When employees burn out, it could lead to more errors and more missed alerts. If more employees burn out, it could significantly impact employee retention and company culture.
How AI-based Security Analysis and Response can help:
DTonomy invented the solution to enable security analysts to reach a conclusion on false-positive quicker and reduce the risk of missing true positives on your existing security detections. How does it work? Let’s do a side-by-side comparison.
              
 
Get answers to “false positives” faster.
Reduce the risk of “false negative”
Get a definitive answer on “false positive”

Talent Shortage 2022: Stretching Your Lean DevSecOps Team
Share This Post
[This is a guest post contributed by George Hamilton, director of product marketing at ChaosSearch. It was originally posted on the ChaosSearch blog here]
The cybersecurity talent shortage is real. As of December 2021, a job-tracking database from the U.S. Commerce Department showed nearly 600,000 unfilled cybersecurity positions. And a 2021 study found that 57% of cybersecurity professionals worked at organizations that have been directly impacted by the cybersecurity talent shortage. Even so, many organizations want to “shift security left” or build security best practices earlier into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
DevSecOps involves creating a shared responsibility model for security and can even help alleviate some of the pressures resulting from the cybersecurity talent shortage. This methodology is a cultural shift that requires thinking about application and infrastructure security from the start and continuously integrating security at every step of the SDLC.
The good news is that a shared responsibility model means developers and operations professionals can learn secure coding and secure infrastructure best practices. In addition, there are existing threat hunting tools within the DevSecOps toolchain, such as security log analytics, that can make discovering vulnerabilities in your applications and infrastructure much easier.
Let’s look at how to leverage your team’s current security resources, and reinforce them with the training and tools to build more secure applications.

 
Transitioning from a DevOps to a DevSecOps Team
DevSecOps is as much about a mindset shift as it is about talent. Transitioning from DevOps to DevSecOps may seem difficult at first, but when it’s done right it can actually help teams ship secure software faster.
With DevSecOps, security becomes everyone’s job. The traditional, slower feedback loops with security are no longer efficient or effective in a cloud-native application development model. As an alternative approach, DevSecOps empowers development teams to secure what they build at their pace. Ideally, this dynamic creates better collaboration between DevOps and security professionals.
There are a few important steps that help build security practices into the application development lifecycle:
Bring security engineers into the planning process. When planning an application build, bring security engineers in to advise on infrastructure design and configuration. This layer of diligence can help prevent security misconfigurations,  a part of the OWASP Top 10 cybersecurity threat list. Security misconfigurations can happen at any level of the application stack – including network services, platform, web server, application server, database, frameworks, custom code, and pre-installed virtual machines, containers, or storage.
Train developers on secure coding best practices. Secure coding ensures that secure software features are built from day one, and minimizes reactivity from the security team after the fact. A big part of secure coding is enabling developers to use the tools they’re comfortable with for security purposes. One example is conducting threat hunting with log analysis tools they already use. We’ll cover more about secure software development later, since it’s one of the most crucial pillars of DevSecOps.
Testing with security in mind. Automated security testing can relieve pressure on DevOps teams to find every possible application vulnerability themselves. Many tools can scan applications to proactively find and fix vulnerabilities, even at runtime. In addition, automated security testing can prevent security teams from becoming gatekeepers that slow down application development and delivery.
Embracing Secure Software Development Best Practices
Secure software development is quickly becoming more prominent in organizations of all sizes. Even though secure coding historically hasn’t been a part of traditional computer science programs, that practice is more frequently built into the curriculum for the next generation of developers. On-the-job secure software development training is often offered to help support the transition to DevSecOps.
Why? Experts say that for DevSecOps, it is better to train developers on security than to rely on sourcing new security talent, which, as mentioned above, is in short supply. In addition, if developers learn secure coding best practices and embrace security as a part of the build process, that lessens the burden on security as a checkpoint at the end of the SDLC. 
For organizations that are starting from scratch, there are many credible online resources for developer security awareness training, as well as professional cybersecurity organizations that detail secure coding best practices. In addition, the security team can be seen as a resource to help enable the transition to secure coding.
 
 
Leveraging Log Analytics for Threat Hunting and Security Operations
Beyond training alone, tools and automation play a key role in DevSecOps. Many tools DevOps teams use can be a major asset in detecting security threats.
Specifically, enterprise DevSecOps teams are increasingly adopting log analytics for security operations and threat hunting applications. A log analytics solution brings together security and event data from throughout the network, giving SecOps teams increased visibility into potential threats and vulnerabilities. When used in tandem with dedicated cybersecurity tools, such as a security information and event management (SIEM) system, these tools can be an incredibly useful part of the secure SDLC.
Log analytics platforms are especially useful for forensic analysis and understanding how data moves across the network. Cybersecurity professionals can use these platforms to delve into events that may have happened days, weeks, or even months ago. These tools can help identify advanced persistent threats (APT), or threats that linger over a long period of time and cause prolonged damage to high-value targets.
Embracing a DevSecOps Mindset
With the right mindset, your organization can build a DevSecOps team that can leverage existing resources to develop, test and ship secure software throughout the development lifecycle.
Investing in this transition with the right training and tools can empower developers and operations professionals to take ownership of security, transforming the traditional security function from a bottleneck to an enabler. Existing DevOps workflows and tools, such as log analytics, can be an incredible asset in identifying and eliminating security threats to both applications and infrastructure.

Addressing Noisy Security Detections – A Complete Solution
Share This Post
Noisy security detections
Modern cybersecurity teams are overwhelmed with alerts from a variety of systems such as SIEM, cloud, SaaS application, network, endpoint, etc. Many teams receive hundreds/thousands of alerts every day and large enterprises can receive millions daily. Security analysts are annoyed by repetitive false positives and are extremely concerned about false negatives caused by misjudgment or alerts that are not investigated due to lack of resources. Security analysts are spending more than 50% of their time triaging security alerts every day and noisy security detections are preventing security analysts from making a timely and accurate response to mitigate the risk. Different techniques/technologies have been used to tackle this problem such as fine-tuning detection logic, SOAR (Security Orchestration and Automation), XDR (eXtended Detection and Response), AI (Artificial intelligence), TI (Threat Intelligence). A renowned expert is asking what the better way is to reduce noise in a SOC (security operation center) (link). Tuning the tools better or using SOAR playbooks? Which one do you think?
Before presenting a solution, let’s first look at what are those noisy alerts and where do those noises come from. Security alerts are generated by all types of detections or monitoring tools. Any alerts that are not true positives (true attacks) are adding noises to the overall security signals. On a high level, we can break up the noises into different types.
Type of noises
A comprehensive solution
Let’s see how to address these different types of noises with a complete solution.
For #1. De-dupe is the way to go. The tricky part lies in how to define “duplicate”.  For example, duplicates could be exact same alert or alert that has the same detection type on the same machine. DTonomy provides a flexible way for you to define duplication.  (#Dedupe)
For #2. You will need relevant environmental information such as CMDB (configuration management database) information, LDAP etc. to make a judgment. Once you come up with logic, you can automate it to denoise either via fine-tune your detection logic or via the SOAR platform. Either way, you will need to continuously tune it to make it accurate where AI is super valuable here. (#SOAR + #AI)
For #3. For this type of alert, you need external threat intelligence to help make decisions. Once you have logic in place, you will most likely need to rely on the SOAR platform to automate it to denoise. Similarly, you will need to continuously tune it where AI is super valuable here. (#SOAR + #AI + #Threat Intelligence)
For #4. For these types of alerts, AI-based correlation helps reach a conclusion much faster. And once you finalize the logic, you can automate via the SOAR platform or fine-tune the detection rules. Again, it requires continuous fine-tuning where AI is super valuable here. (#SOAR + #AI).
For #5. For these types of alerts, AI helps discover correlated signals and continuously monitors them afterward, and appends them to existing ones if the new context is discovered. This is where XDR kicks in and needs continuous context monitoring. Until you find a logic to justify it is false positives or true positives when you can automate it, monitor it, or spend some time on threat hunting which is typically very time-consuming. We all know you have limited resources. To better utilize your resources, dynamic prioritization with aggregated risk evaluation, including the risk of the new context, the trustworthiness of certain detection, etc., is provided to help prioritize your tasks. This is another place where AI is playing an important role here. (#AI + #SOAR)
For #6. The minimum action to de-noise is to group similar events together with AI. (Aka. pattern discovery), then you can fall back to #5. (#AI)

						Too many alerts and too little resources?					
The value of AI
You may notice, whether it is fine tuning detection logic or automation, you will still need continuous tuning to make sure your logic is up to date and correct. This is where AI can kick in and play an important role in your triage process besides discovering correlated alerts automatically.
 
Current detection/automation tunning process:
The current tuning process is usually a trial-and-error process.  Here is the standard process
 
AI offers assistance to simplify the process intelligently:
Continuously validating your detection/automation logic against data is a tedious and risky process. This is where AI kicks in. With assistance from AI, the process will be way easier:
 
The value of AI for de-noise:
In summary, in the process of de-noise security alerts, AI is assisting you
 
Risk of de-noise: 
Any actions on de-noise, either fine-tune detection logics or automation, are adding risks of False Negatives (missing attacks).   The risk of FN, which is rare, has a potentially unlimited impact. FPs, despite annoying and resource waste, present a limited risk.
De-risk of FNs

 
DTonomy’s complete solution for de-noise
There is no single silver bullet for solving the noisy detections problems in the cyber security industry. We need all of the technology to work together seamlessly to address this problem that the industry has sought to solve for decades.

Investigation and Response for Unemployment Benefit Fraud Alerts
Share This Post
Among the many new challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to security analysts, a recent and very serious one is unemployment benefits fraud. Criminals are filing claims for benefits using the credentials of people who haven’t lost their job. They learn of it when they get a letter from the government about the status of their claims or when the Department of Unemployment calls the individual to verify their identity. In Massachusetts alone, a national crime syndicate used stolen identities to try to steal $158M from the state’s unemployment fund.  
Higher Education Institutions are No Exception 
This recent phenomenon has added even more stress and workload to already busy analysts and increased risk to all businesses including higher education.  
Universities tend to be challenging environments in which to manage cybersecurity threats with many multiple endpoints that are not owned by the institution and an ever-changing population of students, professors, and employees who access the internal systems.  
One university learned of the Unemployment fraud when the Human Resources department was notified by the State Department to determine if an employee who filed for claims was actually unemployed. Apparently, employees’ credentials were being shared on the dark web and criminals were then filing unemployment claims on their behalf. 
Automation with DTonomy AIR 
The university noticed that many of the unemployment claims were fraudulent. The security analysts were immediately notified to investigate if data was being leaked internally and began running queries against internal systems to identify abnormal logins from unusual locations. 
DTonomy AIR can augment the analyst’s work by providing a workflow that performs an automated broader analysis of anomalous logging to their internal network and take pre-approved actions accordingly, saving a significant amount of time on the part of the analysts.
When HR learns of a fraudulent claim, they send an email alert to the security analysts with the relevant information. The workflow built on the DTonomy AIR platform:
The comprehensive workflow is here:
Using automation, DTonomy AIR helps analysts handle hundreds of reported users that may be impacted by this type of fraud and saved 95% of the time manually triaging each individual user. This workflow can also be applied to triage other types of fraud such as purchase order fraud, another nationwide fraud scam that is targeting suppliers at colleges across the country.

Use Osquery for end point detection and response
Share This Post
Osquery is a tool released by Facebook for end point information collecting and aggregating. Its potential application includes threat hunting, host-based intrusion detection system etc. End point protection/detection is not new. There are lots of enterprise solutions:
Comparing with these solutions, Osquery is cross-platform(Linux, Mac, and Windows) and easy to use.  Here are several examples on security investigations:
List of all the logged_in users:
 
Find new process connections
In command and control attack scenarios, malware could commonly communicate to remote server or inject to other processes to make connections to remote server. In a typical environment, it is very unlikely to see new process to start connecting out. Hence, discovering new process listening on certain ports is very useful in investigation. This is the simple line you can run to find processes that listening on network:
 
Find processes that are running but binary was deleted
 
Find new services that are installed 
 
Find specific process of indicators(IOCs) in memory or hard disk. These IOCs could come from any threat intelligence field.  This is extremely useful in scope investigation. For example:
In summary, Osquery is powerful. With the help of powerful security data analysis and real-time monitoring, Osquery can be a great tool for security detection and response in the cloud or data center.

Security Alert Fatigue
Share This Post
Security alerts are signals that are generated by security vendors or security analysts on certain things that are suspicious. A “False Positive” alert occurs when the security system mislabeled a non-malicious activity as an attack. Security alerts are overwhelming SOC centers today,  most of which are false positives.  In a recent report provided by Forrester, on average, internal security operations teams receive over 11,000 alerts per day and more than 50% are false positives. Analysts’ time is wasted on chasing false positives and manual operations. It causes “alert fatigue” that we all have experienced in SOC center.
Measure the Damage of Alert Fatigue
Many companies and organizations have experienced alert fatigue but how to measure the damage properly? Here are a few factors that we should take into consideration when measuring the damage caused by alert fatigue.
Ignore alerts that are true positives
If breached, the average cost of an incident is around 3.86 million dollars as a report from IBM. Not to mention Kaseya hackers demanded $70 million ransom and Colonial Pipeline paid $5 million ransom for the attacker.
Lost man-hours: your security analyst
You can easily calculate the wasted time on investigating false positives which could be spent on important tasks instead. The more time they spend on fixing false alerts, the less your organization benefit from their talent and experience.    
Employee burn out
Eventually, the employee may wear out due to the number of alerts they need to address. When employees burn out, it could drive to more errors, more missed alerts, more employees burn out which becomes a dead end and could significantly impact the company culture. 

						Too many alerts and too little resources?					
 
What Can We Do to Reduce Cyber Security Alert Fatigue
There are multiple aspects to reduce alert fatigue with contributions from different roles ranging from security analysts to SOC managers even CEOs. But as security analysts, we need a better tool to enable security analysts to get to “No” quickly while eliminating the risk of missing true positives.
Right and relevant context is critical
Alerts could come from simple rules or reports like
Well, these rules are generating interesting signals but they are likely false positives. Why? Because they can be legit user behaviors. For example, it is possible this user did forget the password and failed login in.
Security vendors may send you an alert about SQL injection attacks on one of your servers. It could be very serious. But the first thing you will need to know is whether you have SQL on that machine. So you will need a configuration management system or asset management in place.
All this extra information is required to identify false positives.
Identify patterns
Pattern, structured information from data,  is the next level of context that is useful to spot false positives and true positives. It is usually not sufficient to distinguish true positives from false positives with a single alert. Most attacks can be detected with weak signals in the early MITRE ATT&CK phase. Similarly, false-positive alerts will possibly exhibit similar patterns as well.  Patterns let you conclude a definitive decision faster.
Better visualizations
Context is great but be aware of too much information that may overload analysts as well. The way how information is selected is displayed is important. They need to be super easy for security analysts to use.
  Reuse historical investigation resolutions
Each security investigation such as threat hunting takes time and very often we will notice something has already been investigated by the same person or a different person in the past but the knowledge was not kept very well.  Such knowledge is an important understanding of your own environment and needs to be leveraged most to reduce repetitive investigation time.
Delegate to the right person
Delegate to the right person to fix this issue. But before sending it to them, make sure to aggregate the information with actionable steps so that those who are affected will be more motivated to fix it.
Ask for a refund if the vendor sent too many false positives
This is kidding:)  Security analysts have a difficult job constantly triaging alerts, so it is important to switch it up from time to time and keep it entertaining! Measuring which tool provides you most false positives will be useful to help optimize your SOC center.
While we were working as security analysts in Microsoft, we have been chased by various kinds of security alerts from different places every day and constantly saw false positives after investigations. One observation we had is that user/computer/system/network does produce lots of wired things. For example, you will be surprised to see how common it is for antivirus software to inject code into other processes. It is impossible to tune alerts inaccurately because it needs continuous improvement. Typical atomic alerts are just too noisy to be actionable.
DTonomy’s AI Solution
DTonomy’s AI solution helps you get to answer “No” faster.  How?
Identify patterns among atomic alerts
For each input alert, we extract important artifacts from alerts. Based on the artifacts, we construct a relationship graph between different artifacts globally. Our algorithm automatically consolidates artifacts that are more closely related to each other and present you as a pattern. These patterns could be multiple machines connected to 1 suspicious IP; lateral movements across machines; a kill chain that includes a list of security detections across different phases of MITRE ATT&CK framework. Instead of manually stitching alerts together for investigation,  DTonomy’s algorithm-driven correlation reveals hidden insights among security detections automatically, constructs rich context continuously for investigation,  saves your time on endless correlation rules creation/tuning.
 Continuously learns out false positives
From unstructured comments to your active responses, we analyze all the metadata and identify normal patterns in your environment based on your response and learn them out automatically. This will be reflected on risk score decrease or explainable pattern that automatically filters future alerts to similar groups. Possible patterns could be “if an alert is related to folder A, it is likely to be false positive with 100% confidence”.
 More automation
It is not surprising to see no-code and low code platform is helpful to enrich context such as gathering relevant assets information or threat intelligence easily.
Of course, human factors are the most important elements in resolving alert fatigue. It is important to address them with a better organizational process. At the same time, it is also important to use technology that can ensure peace of mind and promote confidence by dealing with serious alerts according to a process, alleviating psychological effects of alert fatigue such as burnout. With a better process armed with better technology, we will be sure to fix this problem.

Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security
Share This Post
The development of Artificial Intelligence has been one of the most impactful innovations in the past couple of  years. It has and will continue to have significant transformational impact on technology as well as humans. With massive amount of data, AI enables machine to become smarter and more intelligent over time and perform tasks on their own with little or without intervention. 
 
AI for Cyber Security
Analyzing and responding to cyber threat is not human scalable problem. Applying AI to Security tools and techniques are critical in helping to detect and respond to security issues faster, saving costs and greatly reducing risk. Machines can learn based on past behavior to identify new attacks, distinguish malicious signals from benign signals, and can trigger workflows or recommend remediation actions.
 
 
Why Cyber Security needs AI? 
The need for leveraging AI in Cybersecurity is especially crucial due to several converging trends.
According to Cybersecurity Ventures, cyberattacks are the fastest growing crime in the U.S., and they are increasing in size, sophistication and cost. Cybercrime will cost theworld $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015 and is projected to cost the world $10.5 Trillion annually by 2025.
At the same time, CSO Online reports that there is a global cybersecurity skills shortage and states that research data clearly indicates that this situation not only isn’t improving, but it may in fact be getting worse. The primary ramifications of the skills shortage include an increasing workload on the existing cybersecurity staff, long-standing open jobs, an increase in hiring and training junior personnel, and an inability to learn or utilize security technologies to their full potential. Only 7% ofcybersecurity professionals claim that their organization has improved its position relative to the cybersecurity skills shortage over the past few years. Alternatively, 45% say that things have gotten worse while 48% believe things are about the same today as they were in the past. 
And lastly, hackers are now deploying AI and machine learning in their attack strategies, all the more reason that AI must be applied in every organization’s securitystrategy. 
 
 
AI Basics
Artificial Intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machine which mimics “cognitive” function that human associates with human mind. Machine Learning, Expert System, Deep learning are all subsets today’s AI technology.
 
AI in Cyber Security
AI can be utilized in multiple aspects of cybersecurity from detection to analysis, to remediation and response. Some common use cases include:
 

						Too many alerts and too little resources?					
How is AI Different from Automation?
Automation is simply automating low level, repetitive tasks using machines. AI involves intelligence and learning capabilities, distills new insights and becomes smarter over time.

 
How is AI Different from Data Analytics?
To put things simply, the difference between AI and Data Analytics is that Data Analytics is a traditional analysis to enable drawing conclusions and generating insights from large static data sets; it is not evolving or self-learning. AI has a learning capability that provides insights and becomes smarter over time.
 
AI: Hype vs Reality 
Given the hyper of AI, it almost becomes a buzz in many areas. It makes people believe that AI can solve cyber security issues over night. This is wrong.  AI is not magic and there is no silver bullet on solving cyber security problems. AI’s value to cyber security is to augment security analysts with powerful tools to better handle security issues, to simplify knowledge transfer and to free up resources for more important tasks.
Most of AI algorithms are known be a black box and the results are hard to interpret. That is one of the reasons why many people are skeptical of AI. 

 
DTonomy’s Takes and Difference
Keeping AI as black box will just confuse security analysts and discourage technology adoptions. When designing AI system, we follow these design principles:       

AI should provide deep yet clear insights that can be understood and explainable to humans, no matter how non trivial it may be. And, insights should always be supported by data and evidence
Analysts should have the flexibility to edit what AI suggests in an intuitive way. AI is under the security analysts’ control; however, the analyst does not need to master the complicated part of an AI model that professional data scientists work on. A security analyst should be able to control AI in an easy and intuitive way.
An AI engine must continuously compute and listen to the security analyst’s feedback and be able to provide refreshed insights about a unique environment and new data sets.

How to investigate DLP Alerts
Share This Post
Data loss prevention (DLP) contain a set of policies to enable company to protect sensitive data of the organization. By monitoring email traffic, web protocols, digital media, network traffic, printer, cloud traffic, company can detect, investigate, and block suspicious data leakage either caused by insider threat or external threat.
Due to the complexity of IT environment and the challenges of managing DLP rules, companies may receive hundreds and thousands of DLP alerts per day especially for large organizations. It is very common to see security analyst spending hours triaging and analyzing those alerts. Any DLP alerts that are not properly triaged and responded could cause potential loss to the companies. Here are a few common steps for security analysts to once receiving DLP alerts: 
Here is an example of a sample confirmation email.
Once the account is confirmed, the security analyst will record the feedback and update the ever-growing DLP policies. Typically, you do want to communicate with the manager first before sending it to the account directly.  
The investigation of DLP alerts become challenging when security analysts are facing hundreds of alerts per day. It took time and cost to investigate each one and it poses a higher risk to miss the important ones.   
Solution:  More intelligence to prioritize, correlate, and more automation to standardize the investigation and response process.  
Developed by security analyst for a security analyst, DTonomy provides an AI-based solution to help you better analyze and respond to DLP alerts:  
 Consolidate DLP alerts: 
Clients are using different tools for DLP tools such as Symantec or McAfee for endpoint/cloud DLP monitoring and Mimecast for email DLP monitoring or built-in DLP solutions provided by Google or Microsoft for cloud monitoring. The information scattered in different places made it hard to triage DLP alerts. Consolidating them in one place to enable analysts to manage insights across the board saves you time navigating across the different dashboards. 

 
2. Correlate DLP alerts:
Once consolidated, it discovers patterns among alerts to reveal the relationship between different entities. For example, you do not want to send your employees emails 10 times separately regarding similar DLP alerts but arriving at different times from different monitoring systems. Moreover, the pattern helps you build the context for communication.  

 
3. Leverage historical investigation to optimize your security operation process:
Peers’ insights and historical investigation results are great resources for you to optimize your response process. 
DTonomy provides an adaptive risk score that incorporates the historical investigations to dynamically adjust the risk score so that you can focus on important DLP alerts with more accurate risk scores. The ones that we have never seen before will likely have a larger risk score.  
DTonomy adds augmented intelligence such as is this the first time you see this type of alert, how prevalent is this type of threat is. This type of intelligence saves your time conducting an investigation and enables faster conclusions on threat investigation. 
Start measuring the false-positive rates of your DLP alerts and evaluate the common false positives and use that to tune your detection logic. DTonomy brings augmented intelligence to discover patterns in your false positives alerts and suggest how to optimize your detection logic. 

						Too many alerts and too little resources?					
4. More automation:
Automations are added along the line of the investigation and response process.  For example, you want to enrich your DLP with information of IP, machine from assets management platform; you want automation to send notifications to users in an automated way, etc. 
One important part of automation is the communication to the right person with the right content.  For example: 
All these communications should be done automatically. 
When you are ready, here are three ways we can help:

Efficient Security Alerts Management with AI and Automation
Share This Post
Security alerts are incredibly important to quickly detect cyber-attacks, but today’ssecurity defense products can generate thousands of security alerts on any given day, leaving security analysts at a loss of which alerts to respond to, and potentially missing the most important ones. 
Overwhelming of security alerts
A study by the Ponemon Institute found that the average organization in the study received 16,937 alerts a week and 26-50% of security alerts are false positives.

It is a challenging task to triage and investigate security alerts. 53.1% of security analyst’ time are spent on triage and investigation. Yet, it is still very hard to determine which one is true positive and which one is false positive. The nature of alerts is constantly changing and often there are inconsistent processes and no clear guidance on how to handle them.
Cost of security alerts
Based on a security analyst salary of $100,000 a year, an average TTR of 15 minutes and 100 alerts per day, you would be spending $476K on security alerts triaging. 
If breached, it will cost

Not to even mention ransomware hackers are looking for more in terms of ransomware.  The most recent ransomware attack demanded $70M to return mission critical information to the company.
                

When alerts are detected, time is of the essence to determine if it is real and if so, to respond quickly to mitigate risk and minimize financial loss to your company. Business continuity and uptime is critical for every organization and any disruption can cause not only financial loss, but negatively impact customer satisfaction and a company’s brand.
Solution:
There is no single bullet to solve this problem. Security analysts will need to continuously optimize the process with automation as much as possible. The automation journal takes time. AI as a key element of this process will guide you on the journey of automation.
So what DTonomy’s AI can do to enable you to better manage security alerts?

Ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent, more damaging and more sophisticated. John Chambers, former CEO of Cisco Systems said in June of 2021 that U.S. companies are expected to endure over 65,000 ransomware attacks this year – and that’s a “conservative number”, it could be as high as 100,000. Overall damages are in the trillions and cost companies not only loss of business, but citizen access to wide ranging services such as education, government, utilities, food distribution and transportation.
Due to the interconnected nature of business systems, infrastructure and supply chains, these attacks can be significantly damaging and ransom demands very costly.
The most recent attack on Kaseya, much like the SolarWinds attack, targeted the supply chain of IT services not only to their direct customers, but to their customers’ customers, many of whom are small businesses.
Companies and organizations who experience ransomware attacks must work rapidly to identify and eradicate the ransomware software and at the same time, repair their reputation with the public.
Ransomware attackers are not only targeting large companies with extensive supply chains, they have successfully targeted local governments, schools and universities and transportation systems, so organizations of all sizes need to be prepared to anticipate and prevent ransomware attacks.
Here are some tips to help you better prevent ransomware attacks on your networks.
1. Back up your data
Back up all business-critical data often and regularly and store it separately from your network so that you can quickly restore your data in the event of an attack.
2. Training
Provide up to date and ongoing training to your security professionals and your employees. 70% of these types of attacks start with human error, ensure employees have the most current knowledge and skills.
3. Increase Risk Coverage
Assure solid coverage of your systems with detection, monitoring, analysis and response tools and identify and address gaps in coverage to detect security breaches earlier. 
4. Treat Every Security Alert Seriously
There are many high-quality tools that can detect security threats. Although a ransom demand is the final stage of an attack, the ransomware software may have been on the systems but gone undetected for months. Security analysts can be receiving thousands of alerts each day which can lead to alert fatigue and missing important alerts. Assure you have the proper defense and response tools to triage security alerts to have analysts focus on the highest priorities.
5.  Design and Implement Better Workflow Processes to Best Use Your Talent
Cyber security professionals always have specific roles, skill sets and level of seniority. Design your workflow processes to assign issues to appropriate owners based on their skill set and expertise. For example, use entry level analysts to perform tasks for Tier 1 analysts, or assign specific tasks to analysts with the most relevant knowledge.
6. Automate Low Level Tasks
Reducing repetitive tasks with automation reduces alert fatigue and enables analysts to focus on the most important issues that may be related to ransomware.


						Worried about Ransomware?					
7. Have a Response Plan in Place
Anticipate that you may be attacked and have a solid response plan in place so that everyone knows specifically how to respond and with what actions.
Empower Your Analysts with AI-Based Tools
Demands on security professionals can be intense and exhausting given the ever-increasing number and type of threats occurring every day. With hundreds of internal and external data sources generating alerts, leveraging automation and artificial intelligence can enable analysts to triage all alarms and threats, not just the most critical without additional investment in security resources. Leveraging AI to augment security analysts can bring a 10X improvement in efficiency by:

Don’t take security risk score personally
Share This Post
Every security alert comes with a risk score.  Unfortunately, your vendors each have their own risk score scale.
If you use Elastic SIEM, the risk score ranges from 0-100. The following example on “Adding Hidden File Attribute via Attrib” is marked as risk score 21. 
In Wazuh, the alerts are classified into very different levels. The following is a list of risk score for different tier of security alerts generated by wazuh. 
Splunk has a risk score from 0-100, relevant to pre-defined risk levels. (see the following risk level defined in splunk)
And those are just three examples.  I could probably bore you to tears with a lot more examples from other  vendors, each having different risk score methodologies.  Fortunately, most of the time, the risk score associated with security alerts aligns somehow with how likely the alerts is a true positive.  While these risks scores are useful, they are not sufficient on their own.  Here are some of the challenges:
1.  Security risk score are not normalized
Imagine if your kids school decided that each class was going to be graded differently.  Let’s say Math was on a scale from 1-100, English was scored with As, Bs, C’s, D’s and F’s with A being the best grade, the closest equivalent to an A in Science was an S grade, and language classes used roman numerals.  Ok, anybody confused yet?   Based on this, it’s no surprise that security analysts can easily get confused from time to time with the different risks scores they get from their many different vendors  And even if they don’t get confused, there’s certainly an impact on the efficiency of the analyst that already has too many alerts to review every day.
2. Security Risk Scores are often too generic and therefore not very accurate
Unfortunately, the person that defined the risk scores that Analysts use, don’t know us or our environment.  The risk scores are most often defined when analysts are creating the rules, and that may have been many years ago, at a time when the threat landscape was quite different Some may be based on historical data analyst have. Most are based on intuition from the rule writer. It’s probably not well defined based on your environment, nor is it updated as often as the underlying risk changes.   Additionally,
All this renders generic risk scores much less accurate and therefore less useful.
3. Security alerts are not security incidents. Single security alert risk may be low, but could represent the occurrence of a low and slow attack.    
Half of your security alerts may be false positives. Yet lots of real attacks come from low risk alerts. 
It’s not uncommon to miss risk that’s indicated by a low scored alert,  or to spend too much time on alerts that further investigation results in their being deemed false positive alerts. So not only does a single alert with a high risk score infer that a security incident is occurring, but also a security events can be easily missed in a number of a low scoring alerts. Security risk could aggregate over time, over multiple alerts that are more meaningful as a group over time, in identifying a security incident.   It’s no wonder why there’s so much alert fatigue in cybersecurity.


DTonomy’s patented technology takes input from your many different detection systems and enable security team to use a single normalized risk score. Additionally,  DTonomy’s patent technology automatically correlates your security risks and aggregates them into a meaningful risk score by combining security risks together.  It even takes your feedback, from your determination of earlier alerts, to dynamically adjust the risk score to make all alerts more relevant to your environment.  This  automation customizes the normalized and grouped risk scores you get, based on the evolving context of YOUR environment.  Imagine not having to review the same false positive day after day, when you know from previous investigation that it’s a regular occurring alert.  By aligning risk scores to your environment in this way, DTonomy’s automation makes security scores more valuable and helps Analysts to streamline their investigative efforts.  The cybersecurity experts are in high demand today, because their skills are in high demand.  DTonomy maximizes the work of these experts thru this automation of a closed loop system to help teams better manage your security risks. 
Make security risk score truly powerful to help you better prioritize and identify true security incidents. See It in action.

10 Correlation Patterns Security Analysts Should Know About
Share This Post
Security Analysts receive lots of detections from numerous security monitoring sources.  These atomic detections are easy to set up, but quickly contribute to the growing amount of alert fatigue felt by security analysts that find themselves overwhelmed with alerts.  Contributing to this problem is the fact that as much as 26-50% of the security alerts they receive are reported as false positives or non-actionable, according to McAfee and Cisco.  These atomic detections contain limited information and are rarely sufficient on their own to enable decision making.  Unless the alert clearly indicates the existence of well-known malware or a known-bad phishing link, security teams must look at signals from different places to recover the story of the alert, in order to make a decision on its risk level and what if anything should be done about it. 
Working with DTonomy customers and other security experts, we have seen a variety of different patterns across different detection-types that are very informative.  Here are 10 common correlations we have seen across customers that may be helpful to know about.
1. Example of building up your kill chain: Unusual child process + privilege escalation + registry modification + unusual external connection
There could be variety of different and sometimes valid reasons why a security detection might highlight that process A started process B. Similarly for privilege escalations, registry modifications and other unusual external detections. On their own, they may indicate risk or represent a false positive. But when they start to line up, in the steps of an adversary kill chain, the risk starts to accumulate and becomes worthy of your attention and immediate response.
2. Phishing + abnormal cloud login information
If your employees are reporting suspicious phishing emails they receive, you may have come to the conclusion that having the users login history information and/or detections around abnormal logins in place is incredibly helpful. Only with this info can you identify any following on risk from the phishing attempts, as well as the broader risk surrounding these reported suspicious phishing emails.
3. Network alerts + severe machine vulnerability
4. Threat report + abnormal user login
5. Command and control detection + deployment/patch history
6. Compromised user detection + physical badge swipe alerts  
7.  Phishing email from same campaign 
8.  Repetitive alerts that happen at similar time frames  
9. Similar alerts 
10.  Abnormality on alerts  
In reality, the subset of detections that are helpful in identifying any ongoing threat are often buried in hundreds of thousands of security detections.  This makes it easy to lose sight of the insights that can be gained from the connections between detections. This is where machine learning can add tremendous value, by looking across the data and figuring out the interesting patterns and connections amongst them.  These patterns help security teams to better understand the context of each of the detections.  Looking only at this data, though, is only one means for speeding the analysis of alerts.  Equally or more important is to leverage the learning from the decisions that experienced analysts have already made, based on their analysis of alerts, to help you investigate any similar alert.  We developed DTonomy to enable both of these insight types and continue to learn about more patterns, like the 9 above, which customers became aware of through DTonomy’s Pattern Discovery Engine, Adaptive Scoring Engine, or Active Recommendation Engine.

Manage your Security alerts with Pattern-Driven Approach
Share This Post
Security Operation Centers (SOCs) receive thousands of security alerts every day. Atomic alerts tend to be very noisy. As noted in a recent white paper provided by Forrester, average security operation team received over 11,000 alerts per day, 53% of the security team’s time is spent triaging and investigation and almost 33% of them are false positives. Alerts that provide little context are very hard to make be actionable. This causes the need for Analysts to spend a large amount of time to investigate alerts to figure out what is going on, where it is happening and why. Other times, because they lack the time to do this analysis, they just choose to ignore those alerts potentially leaving huge risks to go uninvestigated by analysts.
Pattern-driven approach for investigating your security alerts
 
Alerts are created to represent certain risks. Combining relevant ones provides the necessary context to better evaluate the risk and enables more accurate actions to be taken. Take abnormal logins as an example. It can be a very noisy detection, because the user may use a VPN or just regularly forgot their password. There could, in fact, be hundreds of reasons why the alert can be a false positive. But if you see this alert, alongside the pattern of other alerts, it quickly raises the confidence of even junior security analysts that something bad has likely happened. 
With this pattern-driven approach, true positives can be viewed quickly as being aligned with attack processes such as MITRE ATT&CK framework, as we see above. Likewise, there are patterns for false positives as well.  For example, if you see multiple machines connecting to a single IP generating 100 alerts at the same time frame, or always aligning with certain deployment activity, that will give you confidence that they are false positives. As such, these patterns, built to create a context for the alerts, helps to identify both true positive and false positive much faster. 
Pattern driven approaches enable you to: 
Save time on alerts investigation
Less time on false positive
More context to determine true positives
Together it enables you to reduce risk with less cost.

Tips and Techniques for Investigating Suspected Phishing Emails
Share This Post
Phishing attempts continue to rise as they are one of the easiest methods for cybercriminals to gain access to valuable information. Three recent phishing attacks include: 
Ledger Wallet
Ledger is a cryptocurrency wallet that was targeted by a phishing email that looked authentically to be coming from Ledger support that falsely alerted users that their Ledger assets had been compromised and were infected with malware. The email looked very official but on close inspection when CoinDesk independently reviewed one of the phishing emails, which was sent from “support@legder.com” they saw that it was a slight misspelling of the real address “ledger.com”. Ledger has reported that they discovered it and patched it and that all customer data was safe, but users are still receiving phishing emails and it appears from an earlier breach that hackers gained access to the marketing database.
Netflix Phishing
As more people stayed home and were watching streaming services, Netflix was targeted with a phishing scam claiming there was a problem with billing and account information had to be verified or the service would be shut off. The link in the email actually bypassed many security controls by using a CAPTCHA page with Netflix logos that directed to a fake page to gather the information that then rerouted to the actual Netflix page. 
1. URLs
Always check the URLs in the email and filter them against threat intelligent data sources to see if they are legitimate or not.
Unfortunately, everyone is at risk of phishing attacks. When you investigate phishing emails, DTonomy suggests the following:
2. Attachments
Hackers use attachments to deliver malware or embed malicious URLs in attached documents. Run them through a sandbox or check the file hash against threat intelligence to make sure they are legitimate and that the links in the attachment are legitimate as well.
3. Sender IP
Check if the Sender IP has been flagged as spam in a public data source such as AbuseIPDB. 
4. DMARC/SPF/DKIM 
DMARC/SPF/DKIM are protocols to protect spammers and phishers from spoofing your domain. In the header of your authentication results from incoming email, check the DMARC/SPF/DKIM syntax for pass or fail results. 
5. Sender Verification
Check if the sender’s name or a subset of the sender’s name matches the email domain. Also, check if the sender’s email was compromised before using threat intelligence or the sender is legitimate. Analyze the sender’s domain to see if this domain was blocked or reported as a scam domain.
6.  Sentiment 
If everything else is legitimate, the email could be coming from a hacked email box. Check the sentiment of the email. Does it introduce a sense of urgency or introduce fear of losing access or stimulate financial interests?
DTonomy offers simple plugins for Outlook and Gmail to provide assistance in evaluating phishing emails. The professional version has more advanced techniques integrated enabling you to investigate hundreds of suspected phishing emails quickly.
Social engineering and phishing account for 70% to 90% of MALICIOUS breaches. DTonomy can help you to respond to this weakest link as quickly as possible to avoid any severe data loss.

7 Free Tools That Assist Your Phishing Investigation
Share This Post
Phishing is an extremely popular type of cybercrime which is used to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. 70% to 90% of malicious data breaches are due to social engineering and phishing attacks. As employees are more aware of phishing attacks, they are reporting hundreds and thousands of potential phishing attacks to security analyst for further investigation. Here are 7 free tools that will assist in your phishing investigation and to avoid further compromise to your systems.
1. VirusTotal
VirusTotal is an online service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs to detect types of malware and malicious content using antivirus engines and website scanners. VirusTotal is a great tool to use to check for viruses that a user’s own antivirus software may have missed and also to verify against any false positives. VirusTotal is free to end users for non-commercial use. They act as an aggregator of information and allow their contributors to share their submission with the security community, allowing VirusTotal to offer an objective and unbiased service to users.   
2. urlscan.io 
Urlscan.io is a free service to scan and analyze websites. When a URL is submitted, the platform scans the website and retrieves all relevant information. URL scan analyzes programming technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and/or images. It also looks at cookies, DOM content, server IPs, Domain register, and more. Urlscan.io packages up all the information and delivers it to users along with a screenshot of the website and a verdict on whether or not it is malicious.
3. Hybrid Analysis 
Hybrid Analysis is a free malware analysis service for the security community that enables users to submit files for in-depth static and dynamic analysis. All data extracted from the Hybrid Analysis engine is received as a malware analysis report.
4. AbuseIPDB 
AbuseIPDB is a platform which provides a central repository for webmasters, system administrators, and other interested parties to report and identify IP addresses that have been associated with malicious activity online. The service is free for all users and contributors.  
5. Cuckoo Sandbox 
Cuckoo Sandbox is the leading open-source automated malware analysis system. The system allows users to upload any suspicious file and in a matter of seconds, Cuckoo will provide detailed results outlining what the file did when executed inside an isolated environment. This allows users to make sure they do not open a potentially malicious attachment.  
6. Any.Run Sandbox 
Any.Run, an interactive malware hunting service enables users to upload and watch the actions of suspicious files without running it on their own systems
 Too Many Suspected Phishing Emails? 
Analyze your phishing emails faster and block hackers now! 
7. Open Source SIEM (such as OSSEC)
You need to be able to analyze the login history of this user and correlate other information to identify what are additional potential risk with this phishing email and if there are other abnormal behaviors associated with this account within your system. 
AI for Phishing Analysis
Not all suspected emails come with a URL or attachment that is noted as malicious by third-party threat intelligence directly. Therefore you will see phishing emails that look benign by going through all the information above but actually true phishing emails. For example, the following email looks totally legit. The sender is from Paypal and the URLs are legit.  It is passing SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc. However, it is true phishing attackers. 

To detect such kinds of phishing, we need extra AI intelligence such as 
This extra intelligence enables you to find phishing emails from stealthy attackers that are hard to detect by traditional methods but becoming more and more popular nowadays. 
 
Unified Tools for Phishing Email Analysis and Response
Every tool provides analysis for a component of email. However, to determine if an email is phishing, you will need a holistic analysis. For example:
You will need all the tools to orchestrate with each other to provide comprehensive information/evidence to determine if an email is a phishing email.

6 things to know about SolarWinds Breach
Share This Post
What is the “SolarWinds Hack?”
SolarWinds is a network performance and systems monitoring software company. SolarWinds Orion is their software product for network security monitoring which enables centralized monitoring and management of an entire IT stack from infrastructure to applications deployed on premises, in virtualized environments or in Microsoft Azure. In early December, FireEye, a cybersecurity company focused on the detection and prevention of cyber-attacks, discovered that they had been hacked via the SolarWinds Orion platform, and also that the threat actors stole Red Team assessment tools that FireEye uses to probe its customers’ security. The hackers, assumed to be a foreign nation-state, had gained access as early as October 2019 via trojanized updates to the Orion IT monitoring and management software and had gone undetected since then.
How was the SolarWinds attack discovered?
From what we can conclude so far, FireEye discovered that they had been breached by noticing a new device that had registered to FireEye’s multi-factor authentication system. A Twitter post by Kim Zetter, an American investigative journalist and author who has covered cybersecurity and national security since 1999, exposed that the hackers had obtained an employee’s credentials and were registering their own device in an attempt to get the employee’s unique access codes. 
What is the impact of the attack?
As one of the biggest cyber-attacks, the implications of this breach are far-reaching. 18,000+ customers of SolarWinds are believed to have been exposed through compromised updates, including many major U.S. government agencies, but also many high-tech companies including Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, VMWare and Belkin, corporations, hospitals, and universities across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
SolarWinds claims that its customers include most of America’s Fortune 500 companies, the top U.S. telecommunications providers, all five branches of the military, the State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Office of the President of the United States.
How was the attack executed?
The attackers gained access to the SolarWinds Orion build system and added a backdoor to the legitimate SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll DLL file. This DLL was then distributed to SolarWinds customers in a supply chain attack via an automatic update platform used to push out new software updates. Once installed, this backdoor then connects back to the remote command and control server to receive jobs or tasks to execute on the infected server. These types of commands allow the hackers to read and write files, initiate processes, and upload information to their servers.
If you suspect you have been affected, what should you do now to remediate?
SolarWinds has released a Security Advisory here. Given that the attack is likely ongoing, and the extent of the attack is still not completely understood, if you use SolarWinds anywhere in your environment, it may be best to assume that you may have been breached and take some cautionary steps.
What can you do to better detect and prevent such breaches in the future?
Given that it is believed that the hackers had infiltrated SolarWinds systems since at least last spring, they had nine months of malicious behavior before they were first detected. Once inside, hackers often conduct unusual behaviors such as lateral movement, beaconing, adding temporary files, modifying tasks temporarily, etc. which should generate alerts to security teams. These alerts are not always noticed or properly addressed as sophisticated hackers often leak weak signals which are usually considered as noise by analysts. As noted by the following, an overload of alerts creates a big challenge on how to handle them.
Many security teams have decided to turn off 90% of their alerts and only focus on the easier ones or the top priorities and leave the rest uninvestigated. At DTonomy, we completely understand the frustration of alert fatigue and overload, but we also believe that any alert that is not addressed is a significant risk to the company. Hence, we developed DTonomy AIR to combat alert fatigue and assure that stealth signals are not neglected within your environment by leveraging intelligence and automation.
Supply chain compromise continues to be a growing concern in the security industry. The SolarWinds incident is a grave reminder that these kinds of attacks can achieve the harmful combination of widespread impact and deep consequences for successfully compromised networks. As part of the cyber security community, DTonomy will continue to help make the world a better and secure place.
Never forget why you started, and you can accomplish your mission.

Wazuh is an open-source platform that provides security monitoring solutions which can be used for threat detection, integrity monitoring and compliance.
A Wazuh agent can collect and store data and generate alerts from:




Comprehensive Monitoring Creates a High Volume of Alerts 
The Wazuh agents run on many different platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, AIX, Solaris and HP-UX. Although it is useful to see data from various sources in a single place, it becomes difficult to manage the huge variety and volume of alerts in the long run. Organizations typically receive thousands of alerts daily and it becomes difficult to manage and address them which leads to unresolved alerts and alert fatigued analysts.  
DTonomy AIR Significantly Reduces Alert Volume 
One of our customers was receiving around 25,000 SIEM alerts daily and managing these were very difficult for them. After starting with DTonomy AIR, they were able to resolve around 15% of their alerts directly using just one of our workflows.
 
One of the large sources of alerts for them were unauthorized access and most of them were generated from several IP addresses. DTonomy AIR integrated the block IP workflow for them, and this helped them block those systems directly which significantly reduced the number of alerts generated.  
Using DTonomy AIR automations, our customer was able to directly reduce 1/3rd of the alerts.
 
Responding to alerts and resolving them without any human intervention is just one of the many benefits our customer now enjoys. Using DTonomy AIR, they are also able to group different types of alerts in a smart way which helps analysts to take action quicker and have a faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR). Analysts are able to see the how different types of alerts are correlated with each other and this helps to find the root cause. All of these factors help to manage alerts efficiently and enables organizations to save time and, effort and reduce costs.  
DTonomy AIR can easily integrate with SIEM solutions like Wazuh to help manage alerts more efficiently. With out of the box automations, DTonomy AIR can resolve alerts directly and take actions on them without any human intervention. Our solution can also provide semi automation on alerts that may still require some kind of human intervention.  
With advancements in AI and data science, DTonomy AIR is constantly improving and learning from the actions of analysts and alerts. If your company is looking to become hyper-efficient with cybersecurity operations, let us show you what DTonomy AIR can do!

Best Practices to Augment Your SIEM with DTonomy AIR
Share This Post
Security Information Event Management (SIEM) platforms are an essential part of a modern Security Operations Center (SOC). The SIEM performs the important functions of: 
Given that a SIEM processes huge amounts of log data every day, it also generates a large volume of alerts. This overload of alerts that need to be processed can result in ‘alert fatigue’ as humans need to handle a large number of repetitive actions, and many alerts can turn out to be false positives or hard to determine its result given limited information. Security Operation Centers need to focus analysts on the most critical problems and reduce Mean Time to Response (MTTR).  
Let’s zoom in the security investigation and response process in SOC center after SIEM alerts are created. The current SOC process can be broken down into five steps. 
Ingest: consume a large set of alerts from a variety of sources so they can be managed 
Enrich: deduplicate alerts and bring extra context from other threat intelligence sources or detections
Investigate: discover patterns and root causes to determine true positives and false positive 
Respond: make decisions and take action to stop the attacks and remediate security risk.
Optimize: determine how to improve detection logic and create workflows to eliminate extra manual tasks and improve the efficiency of SOC center
How can DTonomy augment SIEM and SOC processes to address alert fatigue? 
DTonomy AIR can further augment your SIEM and SOC processes to eliminate alert fatigue and improve the efficiency of your SOC on top of each step discussed above.
Intelligent Deduplication – in the enrich phase, DTonomy AIR automatically analyzes data over desired time frames and consolidates all duplicate alerts together 
Intelligent Pattern Discovery – in the investigation phase, DTonomy AIR employs a variety of different algorithms designed by data scientists and security experts and continuously extracts patterns in alerts and provides other not obvious insights that would otherwise cause analysts to run endless queries. Algorithm driven, no need to manage complicated rules.  
Guided Response – in the response phase, DTonomy AIR leverages the collective knowledge of analysts, crowdsourced intelligence and built-in playbooks to provide accurate recommendations for handling security alerts personalized to your environment.

Healthcare Cyberattacks on the Rise
Share This Post
EHackingnews.com recently reported that the U.S. healthcare industry is suffering a massive wave of cyberattacks whereby cybercriminals are infiltrating healthcare systems, stealing critical data and disrupting health services. This rise in hacking attempts leads to a risk of patient privacy which is even more critical during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
In one specific example, the University of Vermont Healthcare System reported a cyberattack that in turn affected six Vermont and New York hospitals. According to cybersecurity experts, the criminal groups had attacked more than five U.S. hospitals up until the end of October and the figures can go up to a hundred.  
Although the UVM attack did not state that they were a victim of ransomware, it is highly likely that future hospitals will experience this particular type of attack whereby the attackers are able to install malware that encrypts the victim’s files and then demand a ransom to restore access to the data. A ransomware attack on a healthcare system can not only be very costly, it can wreak havoc by disrupting critical patient care and services and potentially exposing individual’s personal health data which is in violation of HIPAA compliance rules.  
The volume, sophistication and automation of attacks on healthcare and other organizations will not abate, they will only continue to grow exponentially. Most SOC analysts are completely overwhelmed by the speed and volume of alerts and the monotony of responding to and investigating known and unknown threats, causing burnout and alert fatigue. 
AI/ML is a key feature of DTonomy’s Assisted Incident Response (AIR)  
DTonomy has deep expertise in automating the critical steps in the alert lifecycle: triage, analysis and response. DTonomy AIR leverages AI to dramatically decrease response times and reduce the costs associated with remediating breaches.  
With adaptive intelligence the system discovers patterns, makes predictions, prioritizes alerts and recommends actions. It provides analysts with deep insights by identifying patterns from alerts that are not easily recognizable to accelerate investigation, and provides rich and relevant context to speed decision making and response.   
The system can be trained to identify and remediate known problems that have proven resolutions helping to speed time of detection and remediation, allowing security professionals to focus on the newest and most critical problems. 
Proactive Steps to Facilitate and Speed Remediation

6 Critical Steps for Ransomware Incident Response
Share This Post
Ransomware is malicious malware that encrypts a victim’s files and then demands a ransom to restore access to the files. These attacks have become more and more popular in the recent years and ransomware incident response is essential. There are several ways in which ransomware can gain access to a computer.  
One of the most common ways is when the attacker sends phishing emails with a link or file attached to unknowing users. Many times, the emails look to be legitimate and from a trusted sender. When the user clicks on the link, the malware is downloaded and can then take over the victim’s computer.  
More aggressive forms of ransomware, like Notpetyta or Ryuk, are rapidly propagating malware that exploits security holes to infect the computer without tricking the users, giving hackers free rein to remotely run their own code. Once the files are encrypted, they cannot be decrypted unless the attacker agrees to give the key in exchange for a ransom. Ryuk primarily targets enterprise environments with the signature on their ransoms “No system is safe” but universities, small businesses and non-profits are equally at risk as they often have smaller security teams and perhaps not as strong a defense.  
All companies must be prepared to anticipate and defend against such attacks. We offer here our advice and guidance to help with that planning.  
Step 1: Preparation 
It is very important that systems are prepared in advance in anticipation of a malicious or ransomware attack. First, prioritize the most valuable data for the organization and assure it is stored in a trusted backup. Test and assure that the data can be re-installed from these backups which are often in the cloud, and that the backups are tested frequently. Early detection is a critical component, scan systems regularly to detect and vulnerabilities early. Plan for incident response support in advance by contacting reputable vendors.  
Step 2: Detection 
It is important to constantly monitor systems to determine if an attack has taken place. Poll employees to understand if any have received any unusual emails, in particular, a ransomware note from an unknown source. Be sure to monitor both automatic and manual detection channels, customer and staff channels, and social media for any indications of a data breach or compromise. If there has been indication of ransomware, try to identify the source of the ransomware email and extract all relevant information such as the source IP and the MD5 hash of any file present in the email. Forward the uncategorized malicious URL, hash, domain names and IP addresses to the perimetric security provider.  
Step 3: Containment 
To prevent any further malicious activity, affected systems should be quarantined and removed from the network where possible, or at a minimum, applying access controls to isolate them from production networks. Affected systems can be isolated by disabling the network switch port that the infected systems are connected to. Assure as well that the systems backups are well secured. Suspend the login credentials for the suspected login accounts. Block the sender and IP addresses of the malicious sender by marking it as spam to help contain the attack. Block access to any identified Remote Access Tools (RAT) to prevent communication with command and control servers, websites and exploited applications. If required, sinkhole the domain on internal DNS servers.  
Step 4: Eradication 
First, use a malware tool to remove the malware from the system. Next, complete an automated or manual removal process to eradicate any ransomware or compromised executables using appropriate tools. Any compromised account details must be changed immediately. Also, continue to monitor for signatures and other indicators of compromise to prevent the ransomware attack from re-emerging. Removing all ransomware related malicious software and tools installed by the attacker will be helpful in eradicating the ransomware. 
Step 5: Recovery 
For recovery, the first steps are to re-image the system from scratch and to recover the system from a trusted back up. Restore any of the suspended services in the system. If required, complete vulnerability scanning of all systems. Also, co-ordinate the implementation of any necessary patches or vulnerability remediation activities. 
Step 6: Lessons Learned 
Ensure that all of the files in the system are well protected and stored in a secure place. If ransomware was found coming from a phishing email, track the sender and message by marking the source as spam. Install anti-malware software to make sure that the malware is detected even before it affects the systems. Ensure that there are proper patch management and vulnerability policies in place and being practiced. If required,  update the current incident response plan. Make sure that all the ports in the network are closed. Deploy a SIEM for critical subnets for detailed security analytics monitoring.

SIEM vs SOAR– Comparing and contrasting SIEM and SOAR
Share This Post
In the world of cybersecurity, there are many different acronyms. Two popular acronyms that are often used interchangeably are SIEM and SOAR. Both tools focus on helping cybersecurity teams become hyper-efficient, but they do differ in how exactly they work.  
Before going any further, it is important to understand what exactly the acronyms SIEM and SOAR stand for: 
SIEM = Security Information and Event Management 
SOAR = Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response 
Now that that’s out of the way, let’s explore what each tool offers and how they are similar and different.  
SIEM 
SIEM platforms have been around for more than a decade now and they are common among cybersecurity teams. SIEM platforms were created to help deal with a huge problem in cybersecurity which is organizing security events.  On a typical day, cybersecurity teams can receive hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of security events. These events can easily overwhelm security analysts. 
SIEM platforms address this issue by compiling log events and data into one platform which then allows for each event to be categorized, analyzed and queried later on. SIEM platforms start by collecting logs from various sources such as devices on networks, servers, etc. The SIEM will then organize the logs and analyze them to detect threats.  The last step for SIEM platforms is to uncover security breaches and alert cybersecurity teams. The cybersecurity analysts and engineers must then investigate and resolve the alerts. 
SOAR 
SOAR platforms are newer cybersecurity solutions that began really taking off in 2017 after Gartner reported on and coined the term “SOAR”. Since 2017, SOAR platforms have become more and more popular among cybersecurity teams. SOAR platforms focus on three key domains: 
#1 – Orchestration – SOAR ingests and consolidates alerts from a wide array of disparate tools and technologies onto a single platform. 
#2 – Automation – SOAR connects a variety of tools and creates automated workflows or playbooks for triage and response for low-level repeatable actions.   
#3 – Response – SOAR enables you to trigger actions automatically to respond to security alerts, reducing Mean Time to Response (MTTR) and mitigating security risk. 
A key difference with SOAR compared to SIEM is that SIEM is consuming raw logs and generating alerts and SOAR is consuming and resolving alerts. Instead of needing to address each alert individually, SOAR platforms allow for engineers and analysts to automate and orchestrate common alerts which can be a repetitive and time-consuming to address. This is done using workflows or playbooks.  
SIEM + SOAR = Improved SecOps 
Both SIEM and SOAR solutions help to improve the efficiency of entire security teams. Whether you’re a security analyst, security engineers, SecOps, or CISO, you will benefit from having both of these solutions. SIEM solutions allow for data to be collected and alerts to form. But to address the many alerts that come in, SOAR platforms are essential. Automated workflows created and processed with SOAR platforms help to automatically address alerts which frees up analysts and engineers to address the most important and complex ones. 
SIEM + SOAR + AI = Optimized SecOps 
On top of SIEM and SOAR, DTonomy’s AI further automates the cognitive/decision making process for alert investigation and recommends actions for every alert and every organization.  Once there is an actionable process set up for each alert, DTonomy’s AI converts them to an automated process. Ultimately, AI enables further cost reduction and mitigation of security risk by making alerts actionable and turning them into automated responses.

Responding to Network Alerts on Port Scanning and Brute Force Attacks
Share This Post
Quite often, security teams receive network alerts by their network monitoring systems that someone is scanning ports or there is a possible brute force attack on one or more servers. According to the SANS Institute, port scanning is one of the most popular techniques attackers use to discover services that they can exploit to break into systems. Essentially, hackers send a message to each port on a network, one at a time, to discover and keep track of ports that are open. They can determine not only what services are running, but what services require authentication or allow anonymous logins. A brute force attack is a method of using tools and scripts to rapidly try all combinations of names and passwords in an attempt to gain entry. Logs will show hundreds or even thousands of login attempts over a short period of time. Security teams can create rules in SIEM systems such as Sumologic, Elastic Search, or Wazuh to alert for these types of detections.   
How to deal with these types of malicious attacks? 
These types of alerts usually start with network detection, yet need extra information and context for further remediation from systems such as endpoint detection and vulnerability scanners.  
Incorporating threat intelligence and expert knowledge, DTonomy would recommend the following course of action.  
DTonomy AIR Built-in Playbooks  
DTonomy’s AI-Assisted platform provides built-in automated playbooks to assist security analysts in creating comprehensive workflows to address these types of attacks. These playbooks contain integrations to many systems such as:

DTonomy AIR Assisted Incident Response for Office 365 Related Threats
Share This Post
Office 365, one of largest SaaS platforms used by organizations, is constantly on the radar of malicious hackers. Companies store volumes of mission critical and sensitive data on the platform, which they assume is protected and secure.  
A recent report found that 25% of phishing attacks are able to circumvent Microsoft 365 security. The more common ways that hackers may gain access to Office 365 (Share Point, One Drive, Exchange, Teams, Skype etc.) environments are through phishing, stealing credentials from users, installing malware, auto-forwarding phishing emails to others, and leaking sensitive data.  
Some specific examples of Office 365 related phishing that our clients have seen include: 
How to Defend against These Office 365 Attacks?

Three Reasons CISOs Need Guided Investigation and Response
Share This Post
Several converging trends have contributed to highly challenging times with regard to cybersecurity which are making guided investigation and response essential.
#1 – Cyberattacks are the Fastest Growing Crime in the US  
According to Cybersecurity Ventures, cyberattacks are the fastest growing crime in the U.S., and they are increasing in size, sophistication and cost. Cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015. “Cybercrime costs include damage and destruction of data, stolen money, lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, theft of personal and financial data, embezzlement, fraud, post-attack disruption to the normal course of business, forensic investigation, restoration and deletion of hacked data and systems, and reputational harm,” says Steve Morgan, founder and Editor-In-Chief at Cybersecurity Ventures. 
#2 – There is a Global Cybersecurity Skills Shortage 
At the same time, CSO Online reports that “there is a global cybersecurity skills shortage and states that research data clearly indicates that this situation not only isn’t improving, but it may in fact be getting worse. The primary ramifications of the skills shortage include an increasing workload on the existing cybersecurity staff, long-standing open jobs, an increase in hiring and training junior personnel, and an inability to learn or utilize security technologies to their full potential. Only 7% of cybersecurity professionals claim that their organization has improved its position relative to the cybersecurity skills shortage over the past few years. Alternatively, 45% say that things have gotten worse while 48% believe things are about the same today as they were in the past. The cybersecurity skills shortage has two components. The obvious one is that there aren’t enough cybersecurity professionals in the overall pool, so everyone is fighting for the same talent. Additionally, there is an acute shortage of advanced cybersecurity skills.” 
#3 – Change is Constant 
The rate and frequency of change is constant and will only continue to increase. Hacker techniques are changing and becoming more adept, triggering more detections and alerts every day. Every company’s environment is unique and changing. New security tools are being introduced on a regular basis and new response techniques are being put into practice. And your teams are continuously contributing new knowledge and new insights after daily triaging.  
How can Companies Respond to these Challenges?  
Given the skills shortage and the volume and sophistication of attacks that are occurring and will only continue to increase, manual efforts cannot respond accurately or in a timely fashion.  
Security teams today must implement a SOAR platform that automates many lower level and repetitive tasks, freeing up analysts to focus on the more important problems. SOAR platforms also include pre-built playbooks to guide analysts in the response and remediation processes.  
But SOAR can only function properly if teams know what to automate. As the context around alerts are continually changing, one of the challenges in security incident response is that teams may not have sufficient knowledge or actionable insights to handle the large amount of security alerts effectively or in a timely fashion. It is helpful to understand how colleagues and others are dealing with the similar alerts.  
Context Aware Guided Investigation and Response  
DTonomy’s patented AI Assisted Incident Response platform (AIR) not only orchestrates and automates many of the tasks that security analysts face daily, it continuously learns from actions taken by security analysts in the SOC and accumulates knowledge over time. The platform incorporates experiences from hundreds of playbooks and security experts that contribute knowledge and provides guided investigation and response.  The system understands the unique context of your environment and provides guidelines on specific actions to take to respond to and remediate threats. 
For example, the platform recognizes what kind of system you are using and suggests how to block IP addresses in your unique environment. The platform is already integrated to more than 100 third party security products and their playbooks and is continuously adding more playbooks. Combining expert knowledge and your unique environment, our AI assistant can analyze alerts and predict actions you should take for the best response. 
Adaptive Guidance 
The system learns and becomes smarter over time and uncovers insights and trends to make guided recommendations and free security analysts to focus on the higher level, newest and most important threats. More importantly, as new threats are evolving, DTonomy is continuously exploring new ways of Incident Response to ensure you have the most up to date recommendations for incident response for your team.

Reducing Mean Time to Response (MTTR) with Security Automation
Share This Post
Mean Time to Response (MTTR) is one of the most important aspects of any cybersecurity organization. The recent breach at Blackbaud, a cloud software company that helps non-profits to support their philanthropic efforts, has had serious ramifications on the company, the non-profits that they serve, and the donors that support them across their digital supply chain. 
The incident has now been reported to have started on February 7, 2020, was not detected until May 20, 2020 and not reported to those affected until July 23, 2020. The number of higher ed and non-profit institutions that have apparently been affected continues to rise, the last count being some 125 organizations in the US, UK, Canada and others. These organizations are now having to notify their donors that their information may have been compromised.  
Blackbaud stated that they “learned of and stopped” a ransomware attack on July 16, 2020, but they actually paid a ransom and believe that the copy of stolen information was destroyed. 
The time between the actual start of the breach at Blackbaud and detection of the breach was 104 days. The time to remediation was 58 days. This gave the criminals unfettered access to freely find and exfiltrate data.  
Costs of a Data Breach are Staggering 
A recent IBM report (Cost of a Data Breach report 2020) states that on average, companies take about 197 days to identify and 69 days to contain a breach, that the cost of a breach goes beyond the amount of data lost or disclosed depending on the time it takes to find it, and this lengthy amount of time costs businesses millions of dollars.  
Companies that contain a breach in less than 30 days save more than $1 million in comparison to those who take longer. Companies also face major fines if they take too long to disclose the breach. Under GDPR, companies must report a significant breach within 72 hours of learning of the incident or face fines, this clearly did not happen with Blackbaud. The IBM report goes on to say in total, a data breach costs about an average of $3.86 million. In addition to financial loss, brand and reputation can be negatively impacted.  
Reducing Mean Time to Response with Automation  
The IBM report states that technology is another element that plays a big factor in a company’s response time, security automation in particular. Security automation can dramatically reduce the amount of time that security teams take to remediate a breach such as this.  
Automating security tasks enables the automation of time-consuming tasks to allow security analysts to focus on the larger and more substantial problems. Automation also eliminates the chance of human error and increases your chances of detecting a security threat. 
IBM also found that companies that fully deploy security automation have an average breach cost of $2.88 million whereas companies without automation have an estimated cost of $4.43 million.  
Speed Detection and Response with DTonomy AIR

Revealing Phishing Attack Themes Over Recent Years
Share This Post
Phishing emails are a type of online scam where criminals send an email that appears to be from a legitimate company and ask you to provide sensitive information. This is usually done by including a link that will appear to take you to the company’s website to fill in your information – but the website is a clever fake and the information you provide goes straight to the person behind the scam.
DTonomy recently conducted research to learn how phishing techniques and themes have changed over the years, and how phishing emails are distributed over year, month and day of the week.
For this research, Unsupervised Machine Learning and the K-means Clustering technique were applied to identify the phishing themes.
Unsupervised Machine Learning uncovers previously unknown patterns in data and is best applied when there is no data on desired outcomes or for problems that the business has not seen before.
K-means Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points together based on certain similarities to discover underlying patterns.
From the analysis we could find the overall theme of phishing attacks by applying Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques and also comparing the phishing attack themes between years. We could easily find the theme of the phishing attack without even reading the entire email using K-means clustering. This method also helped in analyzing how the theme of attack has changed over the years and how they are distributed over year, month, and day of the week.

Augmenting Data Loss Prevention (DLP) with Automation
Share This Post
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is both a strategy as well as software products and technologies that are designed to prevent critical information from being leaked by end users – either inadvertently or deliberately – outside of an organization’s network. The impact of data loss and leaks is staggering – the Ponemon Institute’s Cost of a Data Breach report puts the total cost of a breach at $3.92 million dollars and each lost record representing a cost of $150.  
DLP software constantly monitors the movement of information through communication methods such as email, instant messaging and file transfers, when in use on an endpoint or stored on-premise or in the cloud, and alerts SOC analysts when malicious activity is suspected.  
The system can be configured to respond based on pre-defined policy and rules to enable analysts to most efficiently investigate and respond to the alerts and prevent future incidents, yet the DLP system must be continuously monitored to assure proper configuration and execution of the strategy to prevent data leaks. A medium-sized organization could experience hundreds of DLP violations per day; augmenting DLP triage and response processes with automation is critical to mitigating risk.  
DTonomy’s AI Assisted Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) Platform contains playbooks for DLP configuration workflows to provide real-time critical information about the robustness of the system’s security, and assist analysts in quickly triaging DLP alerts to mitigate security risk.  
Customer Use Case 1: 
DLP Configuration Assurance for SOC Teams 
DLP policies are configured and implemented in email, cloud systems, and endpoints. It is important to assure that they are correctly configured at all times. This customer scenario demonstrates how they augment their DLP with automation to assure the email DLP policy is configured correctly.
This automation assures security teams that the DLP is configured correctly. 
 
Customer Use Case 2: 
Triaging DLP Alerts 
DLP alerts are generated from a variety of different products including email, cloud systems, endpoints, etc. Due to the high volumes of alerts, analysts can be overwhelmed and many alerts can be ignored.  
This customer scenario demonstrates how automated playbooks can help to resolve DLP alerts and mitigate security risk. 
This automated playbook enables the customer to only have to triage 5 of 100 DLP alerts each day, reducing the meantime to resolution from 15 minutes to 2 minutes on 100 alerts. This improves the efficiency of the SOC team by 87% and reduces the false-negative number of alerts by 90%+. 
When deployed in conjunction with a DLP solution, DTonomy’s playbooks autonomously and continuously test the validity of the system to ensure that a strong security strategy is being enforced while enabling security analysts to more quickly triage and respond to alerts.

Speed Root Cause Analysis with Higher Confidence
Share This Post
Root Cause Analysis is a Highly Time-Consuming Process 
Due to the high volume of alerts that security analysts face every day, many alerts are investigated and resolved without understanding the root cause, especially for alerts with weak signals, leaving organizations at risk. 
In resolving alerts, it may take ½ second to mark something as false positive because it looks familiar, but it may take a full day or more to determine the true root cause. The typical process of root cause discovery begins with experts making assumptions and continues with ongoing queries and sometimes endless guessing. A Security Information Event Manager (SIEM) makes the process easier, but the overwhelming number and frequency of alerts can cause analyst fatigue and impede the process of determining the root cause. 
AI Dramatically Simplifies Root Cause Analysis 
Artificial Intelligence can not only reduce the time of investigation by identifying patterns and suggesting the plausible root causes, it can also enable analysts to resolve alerts with higher confidence.  
DTonomy AI Assisted Security Orchestration Automation and Response platform (AIR) uses algorithms to analyze and correlate alerts and other contextual information. It continuously maps out all connections between different alerts, content, and analysts’ resolutions and recommends plausible root causes for alerts and groups of alerts. 
The AI engine will recommend root causes that have the highest confidence, and analysts can then validate against their domain knowledge and determine whether future alerts should be treated as the same root cause category. For example, our system could automatically recommend patterns with high confidence such as a suspicious process alert that is triggered due to a system running a periodic update. 
Transparent. Controllable. Adaptive. 
The DTonomy AIR engine is uniquely designed to ensure the system not only provides valuable deep high-quality insights to analysts proactively but analysts can also more easily understand and have full control of AI because it is: 
AI is bringing augmented intelligence for security analysts to accelerate investigation and response, minimize operation risks and more successfully mitigate security risk.

Best Practices for Modern SOC Management
Share This Post

Running a SOC center with many customers relying on analysts to quickly detect, investigate and resolve security incidents requires the best and most advanced tools on the market today. As a result, many SOC operators are deploying Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR). This is a good first step, but not enough. Despite deploying a traditional SOAR solution in the SOC, many are still facing challenges. 
The top five challenges facing SOC operators in a modern SOC center include: 
#1 – Overwhelming Number of Alerts and False Positives 
The orchestration component of SOAR helps to centralize volumes of alerts into a single platform through integrations. Despite many repetitive tasks being automated, many alerts are not actionable for example, alerts with weak signals, many of which turn out to be false positives. Human interaction is still required for alert prioritization, proper investigation and response which can consume up to 80% of an analyst’s time and be prone to error.  
#2 – Case Management  
It is not practical to triage each individual alert one by one, data must be collected and analyzed into cases tied to specific incidents. Consolidating alerts into cases with relevant context is still a highly manual process which requires skill and may take many attempts to assure all relevant alerts are put into the right cases.  
#3 – Root Cause Analysis 
Alerts can be investigated and resolved, some can lead to definitive actions but many are resolved without a definitive root case or explanation due to the amount of work required to determine the root cause. Resolving incidents without understanding the root cause will  increase security risk. 
#4 – Workflows 
SOAR Automation can streamline operations and define workflows to lead the investigation logic and processes, but as the environment is continually changing and evolving, workflows should be able to adapt and improve. 
#5 – Collaboration 
SOAR enables more collaborative processes across teams, but especially in high pressure situations, relying on analysts to catch every error is not possible. Simply automating steps in the process without alleviating the number of false positives and providing insights into patterns and recommending actions leaves room for error and may negatively impact your business.  
SIEM and SOAR is a great first step to orchestrate and automate SOC Operations. What’s needed to truly improve detection, investigation and reduce Mean Time To Response (MTTR) is AI assisted SOAR. 
 DTonomy’s AI Assisted SOAR addresses the challenges above by dramatically reducing the number of false positives, improving the case management and root cause analysis, and providing insights and recommended actions to speed response with greater confidence on the part of analysts.  
DTonomy AIR augments, but does not replace the human efforts in your SOC, humans are still crucial to the process. AIR’s unique AI enables them to take actions with more confidence because it is

Hackers Increasingly Exploiting Cloud Misconfigurations
Share This Post
Hackers Increasingly Exploiting Cloud Misconfigurations
When Covid-19 exploded on the scene, companies rushed to send employees to work from home. In order to make essential business systems and applications available to remote workers, they also in some cases moved quickly to cloud based deployments.
To support these legions of remote workers and give them access to the applications they need to do their jobs, IT teams rapidly “lifted and shifted” applications from on premise to the cloud and may not have properly configured and secured the cloud based applications.
Companies who prior to the pandemic had some employees work from home usually only allowed it on properly secured company devices over a separate secure wi-fi connection. However, many remote workers are now are using personal devices to log on to the network and in some cases over unsecured WIFI; the attack surface has grown exponentially. Malicious actors know this and look to exploit these vulnerabilities.
Security Risks Due to Cloud Misconfigurations Exacerbated by Pandemic
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, companies were already at risk when moving to adopt cloud services due to not properly configuring and securing cloud environments. According to DivvyCloud research, nearly 33.4 billion records were exposed in breaches due to cloud misconfigurations in 2018 and 2019, amounting to nearly $5 trillion in costs to enterprises globally.
As organizations are now moving to the cloud in record numbers, and doing so quickly to support employees working from home, the number of cloud-related breaches is accelerating as attackers increasingly exploit misconfiguration issues, leading to increased costs and exposure of valuable information. This trend is expected to continue as more organizations move to the cloud.
Lack of Planning Leaves Organizations Wide Open For Security Breaches
A recent survey by Fugue.com revealed that “84% are concerned about new security vulnerabilities created during the swift adoption of new access policies, networks, and devices used for managing cloud infrastructure remotely.” The study goes on to say that cloud misconfiguration remains the number one cause of data breaches in the cloud. And, that knowing cloud infrastructure is secure at all times is already a major challenge for even the most sophisticated cloud customers and the current crisis is compounding the problem.
73% still rely on manual processes to detect and resolve misconfigurations
The Fugue study goes on to say that malicious actors use automation tools to scan the internet to find cloud misconfigurations within minutes of their inception, yet most cloud teams still rely on slow, manual processes to address the problem. 73% use manual remediation once alerting or log analysis tools identify potential issues, and only 39% have put some automated remediation in place. 40% of cloud teams conduct manual audits of cloud environments to identify misconfigurations.
This reliance on manual methods can lead to analysts overlooking or not focusing on the most important issues. Despite detections of cloud misconfigurations being uploaded to a log management and security analytics platform (SIEM) every 15 minutes, most are often overlooked by security analysts unless they are perceived to be highly important.
Secure Cloud Migration Needs AI Assisted SOAR
Now is the time to shore up security for cloud based applications and working from home, as many organizations are not rushing to bring workers back to the office. Given that hackers use automation tools to find and exploit misconfiguration almost as soon as they’re created, manual processes can not provide a proper defense. When adopting cloud services, companies also need to implement proper security measures with real time threat monitoring and intelligent automated incident response.
DTonomy’s AI Assisted Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) provides automated workflows for cloud security detection and remediation to keep up with cloud threat activity. Built in playbooks that leverage industry standards allow close monitoring of all cloud configurations such as S3 storage buckets, a popular place for attackers to exploit. Automated playbooks enable teams to discover, investigate and automatically take action and mitigate risk. A single easy to use platform enables more efficiency and collaboration across teams.

How Does AI Augment Security Analysts in the SOC?
Share This Post

According to a study last year by Capgemini Research Institute titled Reinventing Cybersecurity with Artificial Intelligence: The New Frontier in Digital Security, they stated that before 2019 only about one in five cybersecurity organizations used AI in their technology stacks. But Capgemini researchers said “adoption is poised to skyrocket,” with about 63% of organizations planning AI deployments by the end of 2020.


Cybersecurity executives increasingly believe that AI is crucial to decreasing response times and reducing the cost of preventing breaches. According to Capgemini, three in four executives said AI in cybersecurity speeds up breach response — both in detection and remediation. And around 64% said it also reduces the cost of detection and response.




Human vs. Machine?


However, there is still a high degree of skepticism of AI in Cybersecurity among security professionals. 


Erika Chickowski of Dark Reading has written a series of articles on this topic. In one article she references a recent study conducted by White Hat Security at this year’s RSA Conference that showed that




She goes on to say that misgivings about an over-reliance on AI also come from the fact that cybersecurity pros believe the jobs they do are too complex to be replicated by a machine. And she references findings from a Ponemon Report last year that shows that over half of security pros said they wouldn’t be able to train AI to do the tasks their teams perform, and that they are more qualified to catch threats in real time. Almost half also reported that human intervention is a necessity in network protection.


So what do we make of all of this?


Humans are Still Crucial to the Process


We’re not suggesting that AI should replace highly skilled and talented security professionals; we believe that when deployed in a Cybersecurity solution, it can make them much more effective and efficient by automating repetitive and manual tasks and providing valuable timely recommendations across the detection, investigation and response phases. This is not about machine vs. human, this is about augmenting talent and enabling them to focus their intellect and skill on the newest, most challenging issues.


AI-enabled Cybersecurity is Increasingly Necessary


The volume, sophistication and automation of attacks will not abate, it will only continue to grow exponentially. Most SOC analysts are completely overwhelmed by the speed and volume of alerts and the monotony of responding and investigating known and unknown threats, causing burnout and alert fatigue. And, many attackers are using automation and AI to send phishing attacks faster and with more success. A proper defense must leverage automation and AI as well.


AI Can Focus Security Professionals on the Newest, Most Critical Problems


AI is crucial to increasing response times and reducing the costs associated with preventing and remediating breaches. The system can be trained to identify and remediate known problems that have proven resolutions helping to speed time of detection and remediation.


“With such ever-increasing threats, organizations need help. Some 


organizations are turning to AI, not so much to completely solve


their problems (yet), but rather to shore up their defenses.”


Cap Gemini


AI in the Security Operation Center


Organizations that adopt AI technology have seen many significant benefits in areas such as malware detection, end point detection, network activity detection or phishing email detection. However, no matter how accurate the detection is, an overwhelming number of alerts and false positives are unavoidable and impossible to manage manually, leaving cybersecurity analysts overwhelmed and unable to investigate and respond to all incidents. Beyond just detection, how can AI help cybersecurity analysts accelerate and improve investigation and response?


SOAR is the First Step


A Security Orchestration Automation Response (SOAR) solution, that integrates with a wide variety of security applications being deployed today, can automate many daily security processes. For example:




Some alerts can be automatically resolved, and some can be semi-resolved, saving analysts a significant amount of time performing repetitive tasks.


AI Augments, Does Not Replace Humans


While SOAR provides analysts with automated playbooks, AI assisted SOAR augments analysts with continuous automated insights for better/easier at managing false positives, consolidating relevant alerts, discovering root causes, minimizing operational error, taking right actions, improving built-in workflow etc. thereby greatly reducing the time spent on critical analysis tasks and significantly increasing the efficiency of SOC center.


A primary benefit of AI assisted SOAR is the deep insights that it provides to lead to the right actions. AI can be a powerful assistant and trusted tool for security analysts as long as it follows the following design principles:




AI should provide deep yet clear insights that can be understandable and explainable to humans no matter how nontrivial it may be. And insights should always be supported by data and evidence.




Analysts should have the flexibility to edit what AI suggests in an intuitive way. AI is under the security analysts’ control, however the security analyst does not need to master the complicated part of an AI model that professional data scientists are used to working on. A security analyst can control AI in an easy and intuitive way.




An AI engine must continuously compute and listen to the security analyst’s feedback and be able to provide refreshed insights about a unique environment and new data sets; this is called reinforcement learning.


All in all, AI will not replace humans but is bringing augmented intelligence for security analysts to accelerate investigation and response, minimize operation risks and more successfully mitigate security risk.

Working From Home Wreaking Havoc on Company Security
Share This Post
Fleming Shi, Chief Technology Officer at Barracuda, an email security company, shared highlights from a recent survey that found that almost half (46%) of global businesses have encountered at least one cybersecurity scare since shifting to a remote working model during the COVID-19 lockdown. And that 49 percent say they expect to see a data breach or cybersecurity incident in the next month due to remote working.
The same study reported that the increase in perceived risk has NOT been accompanied by an increase in security spending. Some 40% of companies surveyed said that their response to COVID-19 has included cutting their cybersecurity budget and 50% said that they would consider cutting staff if cybersecurity could be maintained.
Cutting Budgets in the Face of Increasing Threats Will Only Increase Risk
These two notions are at odds with each other. Threat actors are exploiting the rush to work from home with many methods, in particular Phishing attempts targeting remote workers. One example is hackers sending messages that look like they come from authority figures in a company detailing company plans to close locations, begin remote work, or tips to keep the employee safe with credible information from the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Center for Disease Control (CDC). They encourage employees to click on a link that looks authentic to learn more, in order to steal credentials and gain access to the network.
Another recent article articulating things that are keeping CISOs up at night during the COVID19 pandemic highlighted
“1. Lack of security at remote access sites. This is the most obvious. Nearly everyone who was working in an office is now working from home, which means there are many more endpoints to secure from potential attack, and exponentially more loose ends.
4. Phishing. Lots of it. This is the most expected security issue to arise during any period of panic, and it’s compounded by the fact that employees are working from home with fewer potential safeguards in place. Although phishing activity is always a threat that’s constantly evolving, there has been a massive increase in COVID-19-specific phishing activity, and a period of panic can make people more susceptible to fraud or social engineering. Dr. Salvatore Stolfo of Allure Security has seen “a dramatic uptick in the number of COVID-19 scams, largely phishing campaigns and an onslaught of fake emails trying to trick people to click on links sending them to malicious sites to steal their credit card information and their credentials.”
https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities—threats/things-keeping-cisos-up-at-night-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/a/d-id/1337675
Every Industry is at Risk
When companies were required to social distance and rushed to work from home, many security teams were not prepared with the proper tools and security defenses, putting sensitive data and information at risk. Many employees now use personal devices to do their work and although many believe that their devices are secure, the hackers are aware of this and are deploying automated attacks en masse.
No industry or type of organization is immune to these threats. Data is valuable and hackers seek it whether it is a healthcare system sharing sensitive patient data, a retail business capturing and storing credit cards, banks housing mortgage, credit and other financial information, or biotech or pharma needing to protect trade secrets.
Intelligent Automation is the Key to Response and Remediation
The volume and sophistication of these attacks will continue to increase exponentially putting tremendous burden on the security teams. To combat this, even if companies have existing policies, employees should be newly informed and properly trained on COVID19 themed Phishing.
As well, organizations should deploy a Security Orchestration Automation Response (SOAR) solution with Artificial Intelligence that can enable them to more quickly triage and prioritize alerts, reduce false positives and noise, and use automated playbooks to reduce response time.
SOAR augments analysts with automated playbooks and recommended actions, reduces the time spent on lower level repetitive tasks and frees them to focus on more complex issues. SOAR also improves the speed and consistency of response and remediation with better team collaboration and communication.
Next Generation SOAR to Combat COVID19 Unique Working From Home Challenges
SOAR solutions have evolved as traditional providers of security solutions have built or acquired features to have a more comprehensive offering. These products can be complex and costly to deploy, requiring extensive customization and professional services to fit in an environment, only adding to the strain on IT budgets.
A Next Generation SOAR addresses a critical gap in the market today and the one that makes up the bulk of security analysts’ workload: alert triage, analytical and investigation. Beyond just automating the aggregation and correlation of events on the front end, and providing incident response playbooks on the back end, a Next Generation SOAR solution leverages AI to also automate these key analysis and investigative tasks.
Cloud Based SOAR is Budget Friendly and Delivers Results Faster
A Next Generation SOAR solution that is built in the cloud as an integrated solution from the start will enable security teams to deploy quickly and starting speeding intelligent incident response today without the need for costly and timely integrations.

Why You Need to Consider a Next Generation SOAR
Share This Post
These are highly challenging times in Cyber Security. The volume, complexity and sophistication of threats continues to increase at an alarming and exponential rate. Today, manually intensive and repeatable tasks and processes can’t scale, leaving security analysts overwhelmed and fatigued. In some cases, serious threats are potentially overlooked or not handled in a timely fashion; every day that a threat goes undetected can lead to serious risk and repercussions.   
To address these challenges, companies are deploying Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) solutions to combat these overwhelming challenges. The three key elements in a SOAR solution are:
SOAR delivers significant benefits, essentially augmenting analysts with automated workflows to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks and freeing them to focus on more important complex issues.
The solution is not just for large organizations, even smaller teams struggle with the volume and complexity of threats and their ability to respond. Gartner states that “By year-end 2022, 30% of organizations with a security team larger than five people will leverage SOAR tools in their security operations, up from less than 5% today.”
Next Generation SOAR: Adaptive Intelligence
The SOAR market has emerged as various vendors of other security tools have built or acquired companies to add features from other areas of SOAR from where they first started. As a result, these products have become very complex and costly to deploy, requiring extensive customization and professional services to fit in one’s environment.
As well, while most SOAR solutions today are good at aggregation and correlation of events on the front end, and providing incident response playbooks on the back end, there is still a need to automate the key analysis tasks involved in alert triage, analytical and investigative work, which makes up the bulk of security analysts’ workload.
SOAR + AI = A Game Changer
The Next Generation SOAR platform is an AI Assisted Incident Response platform that coordinates seamlessly with security analysts. Being built from the ground up in the cloud as an integrated SOAR system speeds deployment and eliminates the need for costly and timely integrations.
Applying Adaptive Intelligence enables automated investigation with additional context enrichment and alert patterns, intelligent decision making with prioritization and recommended actions, and automated response with built-in workflows and playbooks.
A next generation intelligent SOAR system delivers extensive value, improves the efficiency, efficacy and consistency of threat response and remediation, and better communication and collaboration across teams.

Combating COVID-19 Themed Phishing & Malware Threats
Share This Post
New Phishing & Malware Threats are Increasing in the Wake of the Coronavirus
Corporate phishing and malware scams from hackers masquerading as companies reaching out about the COVID-19 epidemic have dramatically increased as the virus continues to spread. These hackers are leveraging the widespread uncertainty by sending employees official looking messages from authority figures within their company. These emails may detail company plans to close locations, begin remote work, and even include tips for keeping the employee and their family safe by using credible information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control (CDC) among others.
How These Scams Work
In the legitimate looking email, there will be a request for an immediate action to be taken by the email recipient – either downloading a file or following a link and entering their login credentials.
Downloadable files will typically appear to be a PDF of a critical piece of information like an updated company policy, alert from a health organization, or announcement from an executive. After downloading these files, a variety of malicious software or malware may be installed that can track your keystrokes, access personal and financial information, and even take control over your computer.
Phishing links will appear to be legitimate and often direct you to an official looking password login form from Microsoft, Google, or others. The goal of these types of scams are to obtain your work login credentials so the hackers can access private company documents, emails, customer data, and confidential information. Below is an example of a fraudulent phishing email that could be sent to you:

How to Recognize & Avoid Common Phishing & Malware Emails
Like traditional email scams, there are a few distinct ways to determine if the email you were sent is an attempt to steal your login credentials or install malware. Use these tips below to avoid these malicious emails:

Phishing Email
Share This Post
Inboxes are constantly under attack. As concluded by PhishMe Research, 91% of cyber attacks start with a phishing email. 76% of organizations say they experienced phishing attacks in 2017(Symantec 2018 ISTR). 92.4% of malware is delivered via email(Verizon 2018 DBIR). The phishing attack is becoming popular not only because it provides direct access to most vulnerable part of the network – the end users, but also because most attackers are automating phishing attacks:)How to protect your organizations from phishing scams is a challenging problem. Education is the first step. As many employees have been aware of this problem, they may choose to report phishing emails to security team. Hence many SecOps are responsible for triage tons of reported phishing email, some are true positive while some are not.  If they are true positives, remediation is necessary afterwards.In more details, here are some important steps involved in handling phishing email.
 
Triaging one phishing email takes time, triaging hundreds of phishing emails takes more time.  Automation is the key to handle phishing email properly and accurately. Hackers are automating attacks, how about defenders?

Cloud technology is going mainstream with more and more organizations are moving to the cloud to save costs on infrastructure as well as provide more reliable digital services. The increasing adoption of cloud technology has raised many security concerns including compliance assurance, security governance, and security operations. Although AWS owns a highly secured cloud infrastructure, organizations are still responsible for their internal security practices. The shared responsibility between organization and cloud service provider (CSP) can be described through the below picture:
In response to this trend, DTonomy has integrated with AWS to allow clients to enhance cloud security automation inside their organizations. We have identified 3 most popular AWS services for cloud monitoring and reporting which are Cloud Trail, Virtual Private Cloud, and Inspector. Using DTonomy workflow, you have a comprehensive set of tools which you can orchestrate to create your own security incident response procedures. Each node in the workflow represents one AWS service with easy setup and is able to receive inputs from other node and produce output under JSON format. You can place the node at any point so that it fits to your own “gold standard” security policies.
Another advantage of using Dtonomy is that you do not have to get rid of your existing tools like Datadog, Signal Science, Sentry, and many more. We provide complete API integration with these services and will expand our list as your demand arises. You can involve numerous service nodes of your choice into your custom flow and perform mock service tests before launching to production.

Will Your Machine be Hit by a Malware soon?
Share This Post
Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is harmful to a computer user. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware. These malicious programs can perform a variety of functions, including stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive data, altering or hijacking core computing functions and monitoring users’ computer activity without their permission. Once a machine is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. Cybercrimes have been increasing and the global cost of cybercrime has now reached as much as 600 billion dollars — about 0.8 percent of global GDP.
To minimize risk, is it possible to predict the chance of machine getting infected using machine learning?
Let us look at a dataset provided by Microsoft 1 and see if we can use the power of machine learning to predict risk of a machine getting infected by malware.
Note: Click the Toggle Code button below if you want to have a look at python script.
Table of Contents
1) Descriptive Statistics
2) Exploratory data analysis
3) Feature engineering
4) Summary
Descriptive Statistics
We have a huge dataset with 84 attributes. The goal of this dataset is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft’s endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.
5 rows × 83 columns
Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier.
HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine.
Let us look at the description of major attributes in the dataset
It is a large dataset but let us see based on various attributes of a machine, can we predict if a machine will get hit by a malware?Let us look at the distribution of outcome variable
HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine.
We can see we have a balanced dataset, that means dataset has been sampled to include a much larger proportion of malware machines.
Exploratory data analysis
Let us have a look at the categorical variables
We can see that the detections are less in Touch devices.The rate of infections is lower for touch devices
We can see that there is a significant difference in detection levels based on the Os versions.Hence we can see that depending upon the attributes the risks of getting infected can change!
This is the number of Antivirus products installed. In case of a single antivirus, the rate of detection is high. Installing two Antivirus products decreases the rate of detection.
RS indicates Redstone and th is threshold which are both versions of windows 10.
Also we can see that rs4 has more number of detections this maybe as it was a new version
SmartScreen Filter helps to identify reported phishing and malware websites and also helps you make informed decisions about downloads.As you browse the web, it analyzes pages and determines if they might be suspicious.If it finds a match, SmartScreen will show you a warning letting you know that the site has been blocked for your safety.SmartScreen checks files that you download from the web against a list of reported malicious software sites and programs known to be unsafe.
This is the SmartScreen enabled string value from registry. We can see that if it exists and is not set can have a large number of detections!
We will see it is the most important feature in detection
We can see the detection levels differ a lot based on country. This could be a good feature.
Feature engineering
We can see these columns have high cardinality, frequency encoding will ranking the categories with respect to their frequencies. These variables are then treated as numerical.And we can then use them in our model
Now that we are done with feature engineering let us move to machine learning and prediction.
Machine Learning
Let us make use of lgbm, Light GBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithm.Light GBM is a fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithm, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks.
Following are the cross validation scores for the training data inorder to create an optimized model with high accuracy. We made use of cross validation with 5 folds, the advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.
Features that were most useful for prediction
We got an accuracy of 68.1 % on test dataset after submitting on kaggle.These results represent machines and the risk of being affected based on their features.
Summary
Thus we have performed analysis on the attributes of a machine and found the attributes that are most important for predicting the risk of infection. SmartScreen, CountryIdentifier, AVProductStatesIdentifier, AVProductsInstalled, EngineVersion are some of the most important features that were helpful for the prediction.
SmartScreen was the most important feature and it helps to identify reported phishing and malware websites and also helps you make informed decisions about downloads. We have see from the analysis if it exists and is not set can have a large number of detections!
CountryIdentifier indicates the source country of the machine and we can see that malware rates varies across countries and is a strong identifier.AVProductsInstalled indicates the number of Antivirus products installed.Appversion and EngineVersion indicates the version of Windows defender.
This means if we have information about a machine then we can predict the chances of them getting infected and hence if the risks are high then we can take counter measures accordingly.Hence we can see by making use of machine learning we can identify the risks of infection and prevent our machines from getting infected!
Future scope
More complex models using deep learning can be utilized which can help to improve the accuracy further. By making use of deep learning we can create a model that learns on its own by performing a task repeatedly, each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome.

Spam Detection using Natural Language Processing
Share This Post
Spams is a cost-effective method for advertisement. Only a very small fraction of the recipients may get interested in the product, but this is a big problem for most users. Spammers collect recipients contact from publicly accessible sources and make use of this medium to advertise their products. At present more than 95% of the emails sent are believed to be spam and this makes spams a severe problem.
To avoid this, is it possible to detect Spam using machine learning?Let us look at a dataset of spam sms by UCI 1 and see if we can use the power of machine learning to detect spams!
Table of Contents
1) Descriptive Statistics
2) Exploratory data analysis
3) Machine Learning
4) Summary
Descriptive Statistics
We have a sms dataset containing spams and ham. The goal is to predict whether the text is a spam or not using machine learning. We will make use of Natural language processing techniques train a model and perform spam detection.
The dataset consist of text message along with the information whether it is a spam or not.
Exploratory data analysis
We can see most of the sms are genuine messages while some are spams. Let us look if there is a relationship between the length of a message and the type of message.
Spam messages are longer than genuine messages on average, interesting!Let us visualize this with a boxplot.
On average genuine messages are shorter than spams, but we can see it is not always the case as we can see a lot of outliers for ham.Let us find the most frequetly used words in spam and ham messages
Let us clean the data first by removing stop words. Stop words usually refers to the most common words in a language which are mostly grammar words that wouldn’t be useful for this text analysis. Let us have a look at the most common stop words.
These words are unnecessary for the analysis and we just eliminate them.
Let us look at the top 15 words that are present is a genuine message
We can see that genuine messages have commonly used words in a normal text message. The most common word is .. which are called ellipsis indicating a pause or silence and is very commonly used in texting. Other words in the bar plot are words that are commonly used in a normal conversation.
We can see the most common words are call, free, cash, prize or winning and is so different from the bar plot we saw for genuine messages. Maybe these differences are detected by machine learning models to distinguish between a spam and a genuine message.
Let us visualize the most commonly used words for a spam message in a word cloud.
Machine Learning
Let us make use of machine learning to predict whether a message is a spam or ham
While creating a model we need to make sure that it is good in detecting spams but more importantly the model should never classify a genuine message as a spam. It means it should should have a low false positive rate!If a spam is classied as normal message is fine but it should be the other way around! An important message should never go to the spam folder.
We will make use of pipelining and gridsearch in order to take advantage of cross validation and train a model with the focus on precision so that there is a low false positive rate.
Let us look at the predictions on the Test dataset.
Let us calculate the accuracy of our model
Summary
Thus we have performed analysis on the UCI sms dataset. We can see how machine interprets text data and create a classier based on how we train a model.We also saw how important is cleaning and the use of countvectorizer to convert a collection of textual data into a matrix of token counts. This is important as a machine would not understand the meaning of a word. But if it classifies the word according to the frequency it can create a mathematical model that has the same meaning as that of the text document.
Also we saw that spam detections should should have a low false positive rate, that means if a spam is classied as a normal message it is bad but its worse if its the other way around! An important message should never go to the spam folder.

Malicious Website Detection using Machine Learning
Share This Post
A malicious website is a site that attempts to install malware on your computer and may attempt to install onto your devices. Usually it requires permissions on your side, however, in the case of a drive-by downloads, the website will attempt to install software without your permissions. In many times, malicious websites often look like legitimate websites. What’s more, your anti-virus software might not be able to detect it because hackers deliberately program it in such a way that it is difficult for anti-virus software to detect.
To avoid this, is it possible to detect a suspicious website using machine learning?Let us look at a dataset on Kaggle 1 and see if we can use the power of machine learning to detect malicious websites.
Table of Contents

1) Descriptive Statistics
2) Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
3) Machine Learning
4) Summary
Descriptive Statistics
We have a labeled dataset consisting of websites and whether they are malicious or not. The websites are run through a feature generator which stores information of a website which runs in the network and application layer. The goal is to predict whether a website is malicious or not.
Using the features generated from the website is it possible to make use of machine learning to detect a malicious website?
5 rows × 21 columns
The dataset consists of URL, message along with the information whether a website is malicious or not.Let us look at the description of major attributes in the dataset• URL: anonymized URL which may or may not be malicious.• URL_LENGTH: Indicates number of characters in the URL.• NUMBER_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: Indicates special characers in the URL.• CHARSET: It indicates the character encoding standard and is a categorical variable.• SERVER: It indicates the operative system of the server got from the packet response and is a categorical variable.• CONTENT_LENGTH: It indicates the content size of HTTP header.• WHOIS_COUNTRY: Using Whois API it indicates the Countries the server got a response and is a categorical variable.• WHOIS_STATEPRO: Using Whois API it indicates the States the server got a response and is a categorical variable.• WHOIS_REGDATE: It indicates the Whois server registration date.• WHOIS_UPDATED_DATE: It indicates the last update date from the server analyzed.• TCP_CONVERSATION_EXCHANGE: It indicates the number of TCP packets that were exchanged between the honeypot client and the server.• DIST_REMOTE_TCP_PORT: It indicates the number of ports detected.• REMOTE_IPS: It indicates the total number of IPs connected to honeypot client.• APP_BYTES: It indicates the number of bytes transfered.• SOURCE_APP_PACKETS: It indicates the packets sent from the honeypot to the server.• REMOTE_APP_PACKETS: It indicates the packets received from the server.• APP_PACKETS: It is the total number of IP packets generated during the communication between the honeypot and the server.• DNS_QUERY_TIMES: It indicates the number of DNS packets generated during the communication between the honeypot and the server.• TYPE: This is the outcome variable indicating whether the website is malicious or not.
Exploratory data analysis and Data cleaning
We can see most of the websites are benign while some are malicious. Let us look if there is a relationship between different attributes and the Type of the Website.
We can see that some of the attributes show a huge difference and these attributes can be a useful in identifying whether a website is malicious or not. This information may get modeled while training which could be used by our model to how risky is the website and if this is more than a certain threshold a user can be alerted before he/she proceeds to the website.Hence we can see that depending upon the attributes the risks of getting infected can change! 
Let us look at the attributes and the correlations using a corrplot, this can help in understanding the important attributes and avoiding multicollinearity.
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1e434c15518>
5 rows × 1978 columns
Categorical attributes can be handled using dummy variables as machine learning algorithms cannot understand anything which is not numeric.
Machine Learning
Let us make use of machine learning to predict whether a website is malicious or not.
By using random forest we can obtain feature importance which can help understanding the most important attributes.
Let us look at the predictions on the Test dataset.
We have achieved 95.33% accuracy in detecting whether a website is malicious or not.Let us look at the AUC score
Based on the AUC score we can see that we have a very good model which can predict if a website is malicious or not.Let us look at the most important features.
Summary
We have performed analysis on the malicious websites dataset. We can see how a machine inteprets and learns from the features. Based on the differences in the featues it can classify whether the website is malicious or not.By making use of machine learning we can train a model to identify whether a website is malicious or safe. This is useful as the model takes only url as an input and the model can generate other features and identify if the website is risky or not.

Learn how security teams turbo charge SOC efficiencies 10X 
About
The security operations team of a leading private research university with over 30,000 students and 10,000 employees was struggling to analyze and respond to an ever-growing number of cybersecurity endpoint, network, user, and cloud alerts in their SIEM. 
Despite efforts to tune their SIEM’s detection rules, the university’s Security Operation Center (SOC) still received 1000’s of interesting detection events daily. While security analysts were expected to review them all within hours, they found themselves only able to manually investigate ~10% of the daily alerts because of the time it takes to manually prioritize, enrich, correlate, and investigate each of them. Besides being frustrated and fatigued by the daily process, the team was very concerned that they were leaving the university at risk with the ~90% of their alerts going uninvestigated or investigated only after it was too late to mitigate risk. Unable to hire additional security analysts for team, the SOC ultimately sought a solution that would help them automate processes, help address security analyst fatigue, and reduce the risk associated with uninvestigated alerts.

As they looked for solutions, they found a number of vendors that offered SOAR solutions. These products could help them automate processes but would not address their core issue around their inability to investigate all their daily alerts in a timely fashion.  
For these reasons, they selected DTonomy for its unique ability to automatically cross-correlate detections. During their evaluation, they found the automated cross-correlation significantly reduced the time and skillsets required to analyze alerts and additionally connected siloed events into more understandable stories.  
DTonomy was implemented into the university’s tech stack in a matter of hours and was adding value in the SOC almost immediately.  Its AI-Based Analysis now enables them to analyze all their daily events in under 2 hours per day. Giving them a 10X efficiency gain, they’ve fully addressed their core issue of investigating all their daily alerts in a timely manner. They’ve also found that by using DTonomy’s AI-based pattern discovery engine, their analysis is not only quicker, but also more thorough than what they accomplished manually. One of their favorite features is DTonomy’s adaptive learning engine, which dynamically prioritizes alerts and eliminates false positives based on Analyst history of responses. In this way, they’re able to spend more time on new risks without having to be distracted by previously investigated false positives.  
They also found DTonomy’s in-context recommendations to be valuable guides to assist in the analysts’ decision making on next investigative actions and/or responses. Lastly, they have started to create automations using DTonomy’s complete SOAR capabilities and plan to expand on this capability over time. The university SOC is 10x more efficient and can use their valuable resources for the most important alerts.  
Since their initial deployment, the university has continually expanded the number of daily events analyzed. DTonomy has enabled them to cover more attack surface without expanding their team or losing their ability to respond to all events daily.

                            Phish AIR                        
What is Phish AIR?
Phish AIR is an email add-in developed by DTonomy, which provides users an easy way to acquire important information about suspicious and potentially malicious emails.
How does Phish AIR work?
A list of all urls found within an email is displayed to the user, allowing them the option to scan the web page of an effective url. A screenshot, and other valuable information that may be used to determine the maliciousness of the web page and email is then retrieved. The information is gathered without the user actually having to visit the web pages themselves, providing a safe and secure way to obtain insights on the web pages. In addition WHOIS details are easily accessible for each scanned link.
Available platforms:
Phish AIR may be installed for G-Mail or Outlook, via their respective marketplaces.
Additional Information:
This add-in has read-only access to information of active messages, such as the body, subject, sender, and recipients information. This information will only be used for the purposes of operating or improving the add-in. For more information please see our privacy policy.

Cloud Security Management
Share This Case Study
As organizations are moving to the cloud in record numbers, so are the number of cloud-related breaches as attackers increasingly exploit misconfiguration issues, leading to increased costs and exposure of valuable information. 
Despite detections of cloud misconfigurations being uploaded to a log management and security analytics platform (SIEM) every 15 minutes, most are often overlooked by security analysts unless they are perceived to be highly important. 
When adopting cloud services, companies also need to implement proper security measures with real time threat monitoring and intelligent automated incident response. DTonomy playbooks for common workflows provide insights that are not easily discoverable, reduce the noise from cloud-based security tools, and reduce risk by notifying analysts to enable more rapid response.

Compromised Users
Share This Case Study
User security can be compromised for many reasons including weak passwords, use of common passwords across company, personal and social media sites, or data breaches from other sites. SIEM systems look for these but often generate an inordinate number of false positives, so Security Analysts aren’t sure which ones to focus on.  
Security Analysts need to better manage this overwhelming number of false positives by leveraging an intelligent automated incident response platform. 
DTonomy enables automated playbooks that correlate internal and external information to enable analysts to focus on the most important and threatening issues by improving the accuracy of detection and reduce Mean Time to Response from over 30 minutes to less than 5 minutes.

Threat Context Enrichment Automation
THE CHALLENGE:
Security teams need to respond and handle alerts from various tools. Alerts often contains information such as IP, User, URL etc that needs to be enriched to provide proper context. These may include geographical location of IP, blacklist history of URL in the threat intelligence feed or enterprise-specific information. However, one of the biggest challenges that security teams are facing is to make sense of alerts and make decisions quickly. 
THE SOLUTION:
DTonomy’s automation platform made it easy for security analysts to enrich security alerts with context from different data sources.  
Here is an example for enrichment automation

Alerts’ enrichments will significantly increase their signal to noise ratio and allow security analyst to quickly decide how it should be triaged and start responding them appropriately. DTonomy helps enterprises streamline their processes and gain insights from their data without the need to manually assemble them from many different sources, allowing analysts to focus on actionable alerts faster.
